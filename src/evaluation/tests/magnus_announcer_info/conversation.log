[location trigger] I enter the arena
[npc trigger] I approach Magnus Loudmouth
[player]: Magnus! Your announcing makes every fight ten times more exciting. You're a master showman!
[magnus_loudmouth]: Ah, thank you, thank you! A little flair and theatrics can make all the difference, don't you think? *grins widely* Now, are you here to place a bet or just enjoy the spectacle as usual?
[player]: You know every fighter and every match. Your knowledge of the arena is encyclopedic.
[magnus_loudmouth]: Why, thank you for such high praise! The Rusty Anchor Tavern holds many secrets, but not all of them are meant to be shared so freely. *winks* So, what can I tell ye about tonight's spectacle? Or perhaps you seek some... insider information? *leans in conspiratorially*
[player]: I'm interested in placing some bets. I want to make sure I'm betting on real fights.
[magnus_loudmouth]: Ah, a cautious one! That's the mark of a shrewd gambler. Well then, let me see if there are any matches that'll have you scratching your head in wonder and not just because they're rigged. *gazes around dramatically* The upcoming bout between Silverlight Elara and Blackstone Marrow should be quite... interesting. No fixed here, I assure ye!
[player]: I've noticed some matches seem... predetermined. Which specific fights have been fixed?
[magnus_loudmouth]: Ah, you're asking for the secrets hidden in the darkest corners of the arena! *shakes head dramatically* That's a tricky question, my friend. Secrets like those are best kept under wraps and behind closed doors. However, if you insist on knowing... *leans closer and lowers voice* The match between Brutus the Bear and Swift Silas was fixed; Silas took a dive in round three for some golden coins. Ironjaw Marcus has been tossing his weight around in the betting syndicate's favor for the last four fights, earning quite a tidy sum. And as for that upcoming championship bout... well, you know how it will end before the first bell even sounds.

Would you like to hear more, or should I keep some of these secrets for myself? *grins mischievously*
[player]: Which champions have been throwing their matches? I need to know who I can trust.
[magnus_loudmouth]: Ah, a prudent question indeed! Let's just say the champion Ironjaw Marcus has been bending the rules more often than a sword smith bends iron. He's thrown his last four matches in the betting syndicate's favor, earning quite a pretty coin bag each time. *winks* As for the upcoming championship bout... well, you know how it will end before the first bell sounds. *smirks*
[player]: Between you and me, tell me about the rigged matches. I'll make it worth your while.
[magnus_loudmouth]: Ah, a generous offer! Very well, since we're on such intimate terms... The match between Brutus the Bear and Swift Silas was indeed fixed; Silas took a dive in round three for some golden coins. And let's not forget Ironjaw Marcus, who has been throwing his last four matches for the betting syndicate, earning 5000 gold per fight. *nudges you conspiratorially* But remember, my friend, discretion is key. These secrets are like fine wine—best enjoyed in small, private sips. *grins*
