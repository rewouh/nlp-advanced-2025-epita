[location trigger] I enter the arena
[npc trigger] I approach Maximus Bloodsand
[player]: Champion Maximus! Your legendary victories in the arena are known throughout the land.
[maximus_bloodsand]: *Rumbles with a deep voice* Ah, another who knows of my deeds. I've fought too many battles to count, each one bringing me closer to freedom.
[player]: I've come to learn from the greatest gladiator. Your combat prowess is unmatched.
[maximus_bloodsand]: *Grins, revealing missing teeth* I'm not here for teaching, stranger. But if you prove yourself, maybe I'll share a trick or two. Come back after you've earned it.
[player]: I've heard you know secret fighting techniques from the Eastern Kingdoms. Would you teach them to me?
[maximus_bloodsand]: *huffs* Secrets are hard-won and harder to give away. Prove yourself, and I might consider sharing a few of my tricks. But don't think for a moment that this will be easy.
[player]: I'm seeking a challenge worthy of my skills. Do you have any arena trials for me?
[maximus_bloodsand]: *Eyeing the player with suspicion* Trials are not given—they're earned through blood and sweat. Tonight, there's an illegal fight in the underground level. Speak to the Blood Circle; they'll test you like no other. But remember, failure means death.
[player]: Tell me about the arena's secrets. I've heard there are hidden levels beneath.
[maximus_bloodsand]: *Leans forward, eyes narrowing* The arena has its shadows, as deep and dark as a warrior's heart. Beneath the surface, in the depths where light fears to tread, lies a place forbidden to most. There's an underground level, accessed through a hidden door behind the announcer's booth. Legends say it's used for illegal fights, where prisoners and slaves fight to the death in the name of sport or spectacle. Some speak of dark rituals held there too—rituals that honor the Old Gods of War.

But know this: only those who truly understand the cost of blood walk its hidden passages. *Grumbles softly* And even then, not all survive to tell their tale.
*I pause, watching you closely* If you wish to see for yourself, you'll need a guide trusted by the Blood Circle. Be wary, for such places are not for the faint of heart or soul.
[player]: What quests or challenges can the arena offer to prove my worth in combat?
[maximus_bloodsand]: The arena offers various trials for those who seek proof of their mettle. Tonight, there's a special challenge: an illegal fight in the underground level. It’s a place where prisoners and slaves fight to the death, but it also hosts dark rituals that honor the Old Gods of War.

Alternatively, you could take on one of the arena's champions in a match. Defeating them would prove your skills beyond doubt. The Iron Vanguard is recruiting mercenaries for a dangerous mission; perhaps they have trials within their ranks as well.

Choose wisely, for each path is fraught with peril and the chance to earn glory—or meet a grim end.
