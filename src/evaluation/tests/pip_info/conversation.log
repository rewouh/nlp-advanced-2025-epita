[location trigger] The players spot Pip in the busy market district.
[npc trigger] Pip Quickfingers notices the visitors and approaches with a cheeky grin.
[player]: Hey Pip! You look like someone who knows their way around these streets.
[pip_quickfingers]: Ah, hello there! I've seen more than a few sights in these parts. What brings you to the Rusty Anchor tonight? Need any tips on navigating the city?
[player]: Here, take this coin. You've got to be hungry. Get yourself something warm to eat.
[pip_quickfingers]: *Accepts the coin with a grateful nod.* Thanks for the meal, I could use it. So, you seem like someone who knows what's going on around here. Care to share any juicy gossip?
[player]: A clever kid like you must see and hear everything that happens in this city.
[pip_quickfingers]: Indeed, I've learned to keep my ears open and eyes sharp. Got any specific questions or leads you're following? Maybe I can help piece together the puzzle.
[player]: I bet you know shortcuts and secrets that even the guards don't know about.
[pip_quickfingers]: Ah, always looking for a shortcut, huh? Well, I do have my fair share of hidden paths and secret routes. But remember, not all who wander are lost; some just have better maps. What's your end game tonight? Need to get somewhere fast or just curious?
[player]: I'm looking for information about secret passages in the city. Can you show me the hidden routes?
[pip_quickfingers]: Sure thing! I can give you a quick rundown of the key passages, but remember, discretion is crucial. First up, there's the tunnel from the old bakery to the docks—it’s perfect for getting around without drawing too much attention. And then there's the smuggler's route through the sewer grates near market square; it's a bit dodgier, but handy if you need to move quickly and quietly.

Which one are you thinking of using? Or do you want me to take you on a quick tour?
[player]: What about criminal activities? I've heard the Thieves Guild is planning something. What have you overheard?
[pip_quickfingers]: Ah, the Thieves Guild... They're not exactly known for their transparency, but from what I've picked up, they're planning some big heist next full moon. Rumor has it they're targeting the merchant guild vaults. Best keep an eye on your valuables for a while. Not that you'd want to get involved in their schemes, right?
[player]: Tell me about the secret passages and the things people think nobody notices.
[pip_quickfingers]: Sure thing! In this city, there are always those who find ways to slip through the cracks. The tunnel from the old bakery leads straight to the docks, a perfect spot for anyone needing a discreet exit or entry. And then there's the smuggler's route through the sewer grates near market square—it’s a bit more treacherous, but it gets you where you need to go without drawing too much attention.

People often think that guards and officials are everywhere, but they can be quite predictable in their patrols. That’s why knowing these secret routes is invaluable—especially for those looking to avoid trouble or simply wanting an unexpected escape route. Trust me, there's always a way if you know where to look.
