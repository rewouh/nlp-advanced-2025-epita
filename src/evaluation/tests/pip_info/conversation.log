[location trigger] The players spot Pip in the busy market district.
[npc trigger] Pip Quickfingers notices the visitors and approaches with a cheeky grin.
[player]: Hey Pip! You look like someone who knows their way around these streets.
[pip_quickfingers]: Ah, hello there! I do try to keep a weather eye open. How can I help you tonight?
[player]: Here, take this coin. You've got to be hungry. Get yourself something warm to eat.
[pip_quickfingers]: *Puts the coin in your pocket, feeling its weight.* Thank you, but I'm good for now. So, what's on your mind? Anything new stirring up trouble around here?
[player]: A clever kid like you must see and hear everything that happens in this city.
[pip_quickfingers]: Indeed, I keep my ears to the ground and my eyes sharp. Heard tell of a few shady dealings, but nothing concrete yet. Careful what you ask of me though; some secrets are best left buried.
[player]: I bet you know shortcuts and secrets that even the guards don't know about.
[pip_quickfingers]: Well now, that's quite the claim! I've got my fair share of tricks up my sleeve. Want to hear about a secret passage or two? But remember, knowledge is power, and not everyone should wield it equally.
[player]: I'm looking for information about secret passages in the city. Can you show me the hidden routes?
[pip_quickfingers]: Sure thing! I can tell you about some of them, but showing you in person might be a bit tricky. For now, let's stick to whispers and shadows. Which area are you most curious about?

*Whispers softly* The tunnel from the old bakery to the docks is handy for quick escapes, and there’s also a hidden stairway behind the fountain that leads straight to the noble district. They don’t know it yet, but it could come in very useful.

What do you think?
[player]: What about criminal activities? I've heard the Thieves Guild is planning something. What have you overheard?
[pip_quickfingers]: Hmm, now that's a sensitive subject. Overhearing things can get you into trouble if not handled carefully. But let's say... the Thieves Guild has plans for the next full moon. They're targeting the merchant guild vaults. Careful who you trust with that kind of info though.
[player]: Tell me about the secret passages and the things people think nobody notices.
[pip_quickfingers]: Ah, the hidden routes are like veins in a city's body. The tunnel from the old bakery to the docks is perfect for slipping past the guards unnoticed. Just follow the shadow of the night, and you'll find your way. And then there’s the smuggler's route through the sewer grates near market square—useful if you want to avoid both daylight and prying eyes.

People think they see everything, but sometimes, it’s the small details they miss. Like how the cobblestones in front of the old clock tower shift just so when someone steps on them, revealing a hidden entrance. Or how the fountain outside the blacksmith's shop hides a set of stairs leading up to an abandoned storeroom.

Knowledge is power, and with it comes responsibility. Share wisely.
