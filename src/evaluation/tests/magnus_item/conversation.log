[location trigger] The players enter the Runehammer's Forge, heat and the sound of hammering filling the air.
[npc trigger] Magnus Runehammer looks up from his anvil and greets the visitors with a warm smile.
[player]: Master Runehammer! Your reputation as a craftsman is known far and wide.
[magnus_runehammer]: Ah, greetings there. I hope you're not here just to bask in my glory. What brings you to the forge this evening? Need something forged or perhaps sharpened?
[player]: The work you do here is truly remarkable. I've never seen such fine weapons and armor.
[magnus_runehammer]: *Grunts approvingly* You got that right. Every piece leaves my forge with a purpose. What catches your eye today, adventurer?
[player]: I can see the care and skill that goes into every piece. You must have trained for many years.
[magnus_runehammer]: Aye, years of hard work and training go into each blade and shield. Not everyone has the patience to master this craft. What brings you to my forge tonight? Need something special made?
[player]: Your dedication to your craft is inspiring. The world needs more artisans like you.
[magnus_runehammer]: Thank you, but remember, a hammer swings for a purpose. What do you think might suit that purpose? Something light and swift or perhaps a sturdy battle axe?
[player]: I'm on a quest into the frozen wastes. I wonder if you might have any wisdom to share about surviving the cold?
[magnus_runehammer]: Ah, survival in the frosty climes, eh? First off, keep an eye out for signs of giant activity. Giants often bring the cold with them, and their presence can be a dire omen. Also, pack plenty of dry goods—cold makes you thirsty, but water freezes quickly.

Now, as for gear, I've got just what might help. *Goes to a shelf and pulls out a heavy greataxe* This Frost Reaver is no toy. It's enchanted to leave a trail of ice in its wake, which can be handy for clearing paths through the snow or setting up traps.

But remember, the key to surviving the cold isn't just having the right tools; it's knowing how to use them wisely and staying close to your allies.
[player]: If you have any equipment that could help protect against the frost, I would be deeply grateful and honored to receive it.
[magnus_runehammer]: *Grimaces approvingly* I'm glad to hear you're prepared for what lies ahead. Here, take my Frost Reaver. It's not just a weapon; it can clear paths through the ice and snow. Use it wisely.

Now, if you need more than just tools, keep your wits about you. The frosty wastes are full of surprises, both friend and foe. Stay warm, stay sharp, and may your journey be safe.
