[location trigger] The players enter the Oracle's Cave, mystical energy filling the air.
[npc trigger] Blind Seer Corvus turns his sightless eyes toward the visitors, somehow perceiving their presence.
[player]: Seer Corvus, I come seeking your wisdom. Your reputation reaches far beyond this cave.
[blind_seer_corvus]: Ah, a seeker of knowledge indeed. Step closer, let the shadows embrace us. What winds blow you to my ancient hearth tonight?
[player]: They say you can see what others cannot. I respect the gift you possess.
[blind_seer_corvus]: Indeed, the whispers of fate are but faint echoes in this world. Tell me, traveler, why do you seek insight into the unseen?
[player]: I'm willing to listen carefully to whatever guidance you might offer, even if it comes in riddles.
[blind_seer_corvus]: Then listen well. The winds of destiny blow fierce and unpredictable. Seek the heartwood of the ancient tree before the night's end, for there lies a truth that may guide your path. But beware, for not all who seek find what they desire.
[player]: The eternal winter troubles us all. Your insight could illuminate the path forward.
[blind_seer_corvus]: The Winter God stirs in its eternal slumber, and when it awakens, none can predict its will. Approach the ancient tree with a pure heart and a silent mind; your questions may be answered by the spirits that dwell within.
[player]: I seek to understand the deeper truth behind this frozen curse. What can you tell me about its true nature?
[blind_seer_corvus]: The frost binds not just the land but the very souls of those who dare to challenge it. The Winter God is an entity shrouded in ancient magic, a force that balances the natural cycles of life and death. To appease it, one must understand the balance—find what is lost and return it to the world.

Tell me, do you know the true name of the deity? For only through such knowledge can you truly begin your quest.
[player]: If you know how we might end this suffering, I beg you to share your knowledge. I will heed whatever wisdom you offer.
[blind_seer_corvus]: The path to appeasing the Winter God is fraught with peril and sacrifice. You must journey to the heart of the Frostlands where the ancient tree stands. There, in the presence of the deity's essence, you shall find a riddle that only your purest intentions can solve.

But remember, the frost binds not just the land but the hearts of those who seek to break its hold. Are you truly prepared to face what lies ahead?
