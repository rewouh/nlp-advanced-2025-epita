[location trigger] The players enter the Oracle's Cave, mystical energy filling the air.
[npc trigger] Blind Seer Corvus turns his sightless eyes toward the visitors, somehow perceiving their presence.
[player]: Seer Corvus, I come seeking your wisdom. Your reputation reaches far beyond this cave.
[blind_seer_corvus]: Ah, a seeker of knowledge. The whispers of the wind guide you well. What visions do you seek today?
[player]: They say you can see what others cannot. I respect the gift you possess.
[blind_seer_corvus]: Indeed, some call it a curse, but in these shadows, truths are revealed. Speak your heart, and perhaps I may lend an ear or two.
[player]: I'm willing to listen carefully to whatever guidance you might offer, even if it comes in riddles.
[blind_seer_corvus]: Then listen closely, for the wind whispers in enigmas. The Winter God stirs in the north, its breath cold and unforgiving. To appease it, a sacrifice must be made—though not of the kind one might first think. Seek what lies hidden beneath the frozen lakes; there you may find your answer.
[player]: The eternal winter troubles us all. Your insight could illuminate the path forward.
[blind_seer_corvus]: The path is shrouded in mist, but a beacon does exist. Venture to the Ice Caverns, where the truth awaits. Beware the guardians of the deep freeze; they will test your resolve. Return with what you find, and I shall interpret the signs for thee.
[player]: I seek to understand the deeper truth behind this frozen curse. What can you tell me about its true nature?
[blind_seer_corvus]: The Winter God is more than just a force of nature; it is a being of ancient power, bound to the land by an oath long forgotten. Its essence is tied to the very soul of the north, and when that bond grows weak, as it does now, the god's influence waxes cold.

To understand its true nature, you must delve into the heart of the Ice Caverns where the god's spirit resides. There, within the crystal chambers, lies the answer you seek. But beware, for the guardians are not mere beasts; they embody aspects of the god itself and will challenge your very sanity.

Return with what you find, and I shall guide you through the cryptic riddles that may unravel this curse.
[player]: If you know how we might end this suffering, I beg you to share your knowledge. I will heed whatever wisdom you offer.
[blind_seer_corvus]: The suffering comes from a balance lost, not fully grasped by mortal minds. To mend it, you must not only face the Winter God but also its counterpart—the Summer Spirit, long exiled and forgotten. Reunite them, and perhaps harmony can be restored.

Take this talisman; it will guide you to the Summer Spirit's resting place. But beware, for the path is fraught with peril. Only by understanding both aspects fully can you hope to appease the Winter God.
