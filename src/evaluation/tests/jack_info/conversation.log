[location trigger] I find the gambling den
[npc trigger] I approach Lucky Jack
[player]: Lucky Jack! I've heard you run the best games in town. The stakes here are legendary.
[lucky_jack]: Ah, welcome to the Rusty Anchor. I do try my best. What kind of game have you come for tonight? High-stakes, perhaps?
[player]: I appreciate an honest game of chance. You seem like a fair dealer.
[lucky_jack]: Fair enough, but remember, in this game, as in life, there are always risks. Care to test your luck at the craps table? Or maybe you have a specific request?
[player]: I bet you hear all sorts of interesting confessions when people are drinking and gambling.
[lucky_jack]: Indeed, I do. The Rusty Anchor is where whispers turn into truths and secrets spill like cheap wine. But not everyone comes here for the truth; some come to buy it. What's on your mind?
[player]: I'm looking to collect on some debts, or maybe help those in financial trouble.
[lucky_jack]: Interesting. With my ears as sharp as a cat's, I've heard whispers of debts and troubles around town. Perhaps we can find something... profitable. What do you need to know first?
[player]: Tell me, who in this town is in serious debt to dangerous people? I might be able to help settle matters.
[lucky_jack]: Ah, a curious cat indeed. Magnus the blacksmith owes quite a sum to the Crimson Hand, and Lady Veridian has Viktor Bloodworth breathing down her neck for 10,000 gold. Not exactly the easiest folks to deal with, but I suppose if you're looking to make a move, now's as good a time as any. Careful though—those kinds of debts often come with strings attached.
[player]: What secrets have you heard at your tables? Sometimes the truth comes out over cards and dice.
[lucky_jack]: Well, well, you seem eager for more gossip, don't you? I've heard a few juicy tidbits. Guard Captain Blackwood takes bribes from smugglers, and a merchant named Thaddeus admitted to burning down his own warehouse for an insurance payout. But remember, the truth is like a wild animal—it doesn’t stay still long enough to capture. Careful what you do with that knowledge, or it might just come back to bite you.
