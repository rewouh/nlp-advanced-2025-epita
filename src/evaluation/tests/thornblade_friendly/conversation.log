[location trigger] The players cautiously enter the Old Watermill.
[npc trigger] Thornblade emerges with a welcoming gesture, appearing to be a simple merchant.
[player]: Hello there! I was told I might find a merchant at this mill.
[thornblade_the_bandit]: *Looks around cautiously, scanning the area for any signs of danger.* What brings you to an abandoned mill? Merchant or something else?
[player]: You seem like a successful businessman. This must be a good location for trade.
[thornblade_the_bandit]: *Chuckles darkly, eyeing the player with suspicion.* Success is just another word for luck and dirty tricks. And this old mill might have stories to tell, but not to you. What do you really want here?
[player]: I appreciate you taking the time to speak with me. Not everyone is so welcoming to travelers.
[thornblade_the_bandit]: *Grin widens, showing sharp teeth.* Well, some folk are worth the trouble. But don't get too cozy yet. What's in it for me if I play along?
[player]: You must know the area well. Have you been trading here long?
[thornblade_the_bandit]: *Laughs softly and shakes head.* Not as a merchant, but this place has seen more than its share of deals gone bad. Why do you ask so many questions? You shouldn't be too nosy around here.
[player]: I'm always interested in learning about successful ventures. What's your secret to thriving out here?
[thornblade_the_bandit]: *Snorts derisively.* Thriving out here is all about knowing when to cut your losses and move on. Not everyone has the luxury of staying in one place. So, you ask questions like a spy, or are you just looking for trouble?
[player]: Between you and me, where do you keep your most valuable goods? I imagine security is important in your line of work.
[thornblade_the_bandit]: *Looks around again, ensuring no one can overhear.* If I told you, it'd be less secure, wouldn't it? Security's about being unpredictable. Now, what makes you think I have anything worth keeping around here?
