[location trigger] The players enter the Grand Library, shelves of books towering above them.
[npc trigger] Professor Aldric Thorne looks up from his research and acknowledges the visitors.
[player]: Professor Thorne, I understand you're conducting important research here.
[professor_aldric]: Ah, a scholar of your ilk! I do indeed toil away at uncovering ancient secrets. What brings such an inquisitive mind as yours to the grand library tonight?
[player]: Your work on ancient history is renowned. It must be challenging to gather all the necessary materials.
[professor_aldric]: Indeed, the task is both arduous and enlightening. Every tome and fragment brings me closer to the truths of our past. How can I assist you in your scholarly pursuits tonight?
[player]: I'm an adventurer with experience in exploring dangerous ruins and ancient sites.
[professor_aldric]: Ah, a true explorer! The perils of such ventures are well known to me, though they pale in comparison to the dangers of losing one's thoughts on matters of history. What quests have brought you to these hallowed halls? Are you seeking knowledge that may aid your travels, or perhaps artifacts from ages past?
[player]: If you need someone to retrieve rare books or artifacts, I'm well-equipped for such tasks.
[professor_aldric]: Excellent! Your skills would be invaluable. I am currently studying ancient giant runes, and I believe certain relics might hold the key to decoding them fully. Would you be willing to undertake this quest? The rewards could be substantial, both in knowledge and perhaps even in coin.
[player]: Do you have any expeditions or recovery missions that require assistance?
[professor_aldric]: Indeed, there are several projects where your skills could prove crucial. I am currently working on deciphering the ancient runes found in the ruins of Vindorax, a city lost to time and frost. These runes hold secrets about the Frost Giant Wars, which could be pivotal for understanding our history. Would you be willing to venture into those icy depths and retrieve the artifacts needed to advance my research? The rewards are not just scholarly but also... quite lucrative.
[player]: I'd be glad to help advance your research by acquiring whatever ancient materials you need.
[professor_aldric]: Splendid! Your assistance will be invaluable. I have a list of specific items and ruins that must be located. We shall depart first thing in the morning, before dawn's light creeps over the city. Will you prepare yourself for this quest? The journey will not be without its challenges, but together we can uncover truths long forgotten.
