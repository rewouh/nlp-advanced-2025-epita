[location trigger] The players enter the Grand Library, shelves of books towering above them.
[npc trigger] Professor Aldric Thorne looks up from his research and acknowledges the visitors.
[player]: Professor Thorne, I understand you're conducting important research here.
[professor_aldric]: Ah, a scholar of some renown has finally deigned to visit this humble library! Yes, I am indeed engrossed in uncovering the ancient secrets hidden within these tomes. What brings such an illustrious figure as yourself to the dusty stacks today?
[player]: Your work on ancient history is renowned. It must be challenging to gather all the necessary materials.
[professor_aldric]: Indeed, it is a task both arduous and rewarding. The quest for knowledge often leads one down unexpected paths. Have you come across any particular texts or artifacts that piqued your interest? Perhaps we might collaborate on this journey of discovery.
[player]: I'm an adventurer with experience in exploring dangerous ruins and ancient sites.
[professor_aldric]: Fascinating! An adventurer's tale would be a welcome addition to my studies. Have you encountered any peculiar runes or symbols during your travels? They might hold the key to unlocking long-lost knowledge... or at least make for an interesting case study.
[player]: If you need someone to retrieve rare books or artifacts, I'm well-equipped for such tasks.
[professor_aldric]: Ah, an adventurer of great promise! If you should come across any ancient texts or symbols during your next venture, do bring them back here. I have a hunch they may hold the answers to questions that have plagued scholars for ages. And perhaps, if fortune smiles upon us, we might find a way to uncover more about those frost giants and their runes.
[player]: Do you have any expeditions or recovery missions that require assistance?
[professor_aldric]: Ah, an adventurous spirit! I do have a few enigmatic artifacts that require retrieval from a perilous location. It would be most helpful if one of your ilk were to undertake the task. The Lighthouse of Shadows has been making strange noises at night, and some believe it houses ancient relics. Would you dare to investigate?
[player]: I'd be glad to help advance your research by acquiring whatever ancient materials you need.
[professor_aldric]: Excellent! The Lighthouse of Shadows is a treacherous place, but I have faith in your prowess. If you manage to retrieve the artifacts from there, they will undoubtedly provide invaluable insights into our forgotten past.

In return, would you like me to share some preliminary notes on giant runes that I've managed to decode? They might give you a leg up in understanding their symbols and messages.
