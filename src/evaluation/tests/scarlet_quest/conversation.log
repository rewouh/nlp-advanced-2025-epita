[location trigger] I find the rebel hideout
[npc trigger] I approach Scarlet Flame
[player]: Scarlet, I've heard of your fight against the oppressive government. Your cause is just.
[scarlet_flame]: Ah, a supporter! That's encouraging to hear. We're at a critical juncture now; every hand helps. What can you offer?
[player]: The nobles hoard resources while common people freeze and starve. This cannot continue.
[scarlet_flame]: Indeed, it must change. The winter solstice is drawing near—our first phase of the rebellion hinges on that night. We need to ensure the noble's grain stores are sabotaged. Have you any contacts among the merchants who might assist?
[player]: I believe in freedom and equality. I want to help bring change to this town.
[scarlet_flame]: Excellent! Your conviction is exactly what we need. Tonight, I'll brief you on our plans. We need someone with inside knowledge of the grain stores—do you have a contact who can sneak us in?
[player]: What are your plans for the rebellion? How will you strike against the corrupt nobles?
[scarlet_flame]: Phase one is underway; we're focusing on disrupting the noble's grain supplies. It's crucial that the people don't starve while the wealthy hoard their wealth. Once the panic starts, it'll be easier to rally support for our cause. Stay sharp and be ready for phase two, where we target those who directly abuse the poor.
[player]: I imagine you have weapons and supplies hidden throughout the city. Where are your caches?
[scarlet_flame]: *Scarlet's eyes narrow as she considers the question carefully.* I cannot reveal our caches just yet. Trust me, when the time is right, they will be crucial to our success. For now, let's focus on tonight's mission. Can you find someone who can assist us with the grain stores? Trust is a precious thing in these times.
[player]: What can I do to join your rebellion? Give me a mission to prove my commitment.
[scarlet_flame]: Excellent, a true ally seeks trials by fire. Your first task is to gather intelligence on the grain storage facility. Tonight, after sunset, make your way to the old mill and observe its defenses. Return here with detailed information on the guards' patrol patterns and any security measures in place. Remember, stealth is key. Failure could compromise our plans.
