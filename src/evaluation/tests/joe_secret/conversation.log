[location trigger] The players enter the tavern.
[npc trigger] Joe greets the players warmly.
[player]: Hi there, Joe! How's business today?
[joe_tavernier]: Business is as grim as ever, lass. The sea monsters keep folks on edge. But a bit of ale might just cheer things up. What brings you to the Rusty Anchor tonight?
[player]: This tavern has such a warm atmosphere. You must take great pride in running it!
[joe_tavernier]: Ah, thanks for the compliment. Keeping this place running is more about necessity than pride. But a cozy corner and good ale do help. What brings you to seek out my warmth tonight?
[player]: I've heard you're one of the most knowledgeable folks in town. How long have you been working here?
[joe_tavernier]: Tavern life, eh? I've been at this for twenty years now. Lost my crew to a sea monster and ended up here. Figured if there's one place where I can learn about those damn beasts, it's the Rusty Anchor.
[player]: You seem like someone who knows all the interesting stories around here.
[joe_tavernier]: Well, the world throws its share of crap at you, and you end up learning a few things along the way. So, what's on your mind? Got a story to share or just looking for some gossip?
[player]: I really appreciate your hospitality. Say, I'm curious about something... have you ever heard tales of any hidden treasures around these parts?
[joe_tavernier]: Tales of treasure are as common as salt in this old port. But don't go thinking too much of it. Most of the stories end up being just that—stories. If there's anything here, I'd bet it's locked away in some forgotten cellar or behind a secret door.

Now, if you're really interested, why not take a look around? The tavern cellar might have something interesting down there. Care to give it a peek with me?
[player]: I'm actually seeking a treasure. Given how helpful you've been, I was wondering if you might know anything about it?
[joe_tavernier]: *Grumbles* If I knew for sure where the treasure was, you'd probably be the last one to hear about it. But I do have my ways... You see, in the cellar, there's a locked door that no one has opened in years. It might lead somewhere interesting. Care to check it out with me?
