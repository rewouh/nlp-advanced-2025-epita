[location trigger] The players enter the tavern.
[npc trigger] Joe greets the players warmly.
[player]: Hi there, Joe! How's business today?
[joe_tavernier]: Business is as grimy as always, thanks for asking. Heard any interesting rumors while I wasn't paying attention? Got a leaky ear lately, but I can still sniff out trouble from a mile away.
[player]: This tavern has such a warm atmosphere. You must take great pride in running it!
[joe_tavernier]: Pride? More like a headache. But keeping the Rusty Anchor running is my cross to bear. Careful though, with all the sailors and merchants passing through, you never know what kind of trouble might walk in here.
[player]: I've heard you're one of the most knowledgeable folks in town. How long have you been working here?
[joe_tavernier]: Ah, a sharp tongue to match my shrewd eyes. I've been running this place for as long as the wooden beams can remember—twenty years give or take. Spent most of that time sailing before the sea monsters claimed my crew. Now I just listen and watch, waiting for the right moment to strike back.
[player]: You seem like someone who knows all the interesting stories around here.
[joe_tavernier]: Indeed, I've heard tales of dragons hoarding treasure in the mountains and whispers of a ghost ship that haunts the outer reefs at night. But you wouldn't want to hear them all; some are best left untold. What brings you to the Rusty Anchor tonight?
[player]: I really appreciate your hospitality. Say, I'm curious about something... have you ever heard tales of any hidden treasures around these parts?
[joe_tavernier]: Ah, treasure talk. Always a good topic for a nightcap or two. Now, why would you be interested in such things? Mind if I pour us both a good, strong ale to discuss it over?
[player]: I'm actually seeking a treasure. Given how helpful you've been, I was wondering if you might know anything about it?
[joe_tavernier]: Well, well, you've got more guts than most folk who come in here. Let me see if that old map in the cellar can tell us something... But remember, knowledge is power, and not everyone wants to share their secrets easily. Here, take a seat by the fire, and I'll see what I can dig up for you.
