[location trigger] I go to the beast kennels
[npc trigger] I approach Brutus Beastmaster
[player]: Brutus, your way with animals is remarkable. I've never seen such well-trained beasts.
[brutus_beastmaster]: Thank you for the compliment. I take great care in ensuring they are not just trained but also treated with respect and understanding. How can my skills be of service to you today?
[player]: You clearly have a deep respect for all creatures. That's admirable.
[brutus_beastmaster]: Indeed, every creature has its own strength and spirit that should be honored. I believe in finding the best within each one. Is there something specific you're looking into or seeking help with tonight?
[player]: I travel through dangerous areas often. Having protection from wild animals would be invaluable.
[brutus_beastmaster]: I understand your need for safety. Perhaps we could discuss which creatures might serve as effective companions and how to best prepare them for such duties.
[player]: Could you craft me a wolf totem? I'd be honored to carry something made by your skilled hands.
[brutus_beastmaster]: Certainly, a wolf totem would make a fine companion and protector. When can we begin the process? We'll need to gather some materials and perhaps a bit of time to ensure it's crafted just right for you.
