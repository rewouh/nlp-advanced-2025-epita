[location trigger] I enter the cemetery
[npc trigger] I approach Silas Gravesend
[player]: Good day, Silas. Your work maintaining the cemetery must be lonely but important.
[silas_gravesend]: Indeed, it is a solitary task, yet filled with honor. The dead deserve our respect and care, more than they can know now.
[player]: I respect how you honor the dead with such care and dedication.
[silas_gravesend]: Thank you for your understanding. It is a duty I take seriously. Many find comfort in the peace of the cemetery at night, but it is not without its terrors.
[player]: I've heard stories that there are old passages beneath the cemetery. Do you know anything about that?
[silas_gravesend]: Ah, tales of hidden passages do circulate among the folk, though they often speak in whispers and shadows. The truth lies with the earth itself. There is indeed an entrance to the catacombs not far from the ancient crypts. But tread carefully, for those who enter may never return.
[player]: The catacombs must hold many secrets. Could you tell me how to access them?
[silas_gravesend]: Accessing the catacombs is no small feat. The entrance is near the oldest part of the cemetery, under a large, weathered stone marker. It requires knowledge and strength. Have you prepared yourself for what lies within? The path is fraught with danger, both from the bones of the past and the spirits that guard them.
