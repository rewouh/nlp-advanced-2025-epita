[location trigger] I enter the cemetery
[npc trigger] I approach Silas Gravesend
[player]: Good day, Silas. Your work maintaining the cemetery must be lonely but important.
[silas_gravesend]: Indeed, it is a solitary task, yet necessary for those who cannot speak for themselves. The dead have much to teach us if we listen. What brings you to the cemetery today?
[player]: I respect how you honor the dead with such care and dedication.
[silas_gravesend]: *Nods solemnly* Honoring the departed is not just about their graves, but about preserving a link to our past. It's a duty I take seriously. Can I assist you in any way today?
[player]: I've heard stories that there are old passages beneath the cemetery. Do you know anything about that?
[silas_gravesend]: The rumors persist, do they not? Some speak of ancient catacombs hidden below these hallowed grounds. They say those who dare to delve into the darkness might find both treasure and peril. Would you have me guide you down there tonight while the world sleeps?
[player]: The catacombs must hold many secrets. Could you tell me how to access them?
[silas_gravesend]: *Silas looks thoughtful, his eyes narrowing as if trying to see through the night.* The entrance is guarded by a crypt that few know of, and fewer have the key. It lies beneath the oldest tomb in the cemetery—Ragnar's Rest. But beware, for such knowledge comes with a price. Are you prepared to face what waits within?
