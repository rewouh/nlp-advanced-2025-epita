[location trigger] The players approach the Northern Border Outpost with hands visible and non-threatening.
[npc trigger] Red Fang watches the approaching figures warily, weapon ready but not yet drawn.
[player]: Warrior, I come in peace. I mean no harm to you or this outpost.
[red_fang_orc]: Hmph. Stranger, with the rumors of goblin raids and the Iron Vanguard on the lookout for mercenaries, I can't afford any distractions. What brings you here?
[player]: I respect your strength and your duty here. You guard this border with honor.
[red_fang_orc]: *raises an eyebrow* Honorable? More like cautious. Stranger, if you're truly here to help, prove it. Tell me why I shouldn't make mince meat out of anyone who steps foot in these mountains without permission.
[player]: I understand your caution with strangers. These are dangerous times for everyone.
[red_fang_orc]: Hmm, I'll consider that. But don't think you're earning any easy trust just yet. What's your story? Why do you think I'd need a reason not to rip out your throat right now?
[player]: You carry yourself like a protector, not just a guard. There's more to your duty than keeping borders, isn't there?
[red_fang_orc]: *narrows eyes* More to my duty, huh? You're on thin ice stranger. *pauses, considering* Tell me something, orc or no, what do you know of the refugees in the mountains?ispers softly*
[player]: I believe everyone has their reasons for the choices they make. What drives you to stand watch here?
[red_fang_orc]: Survival and loyalty drive me. These mountains are my home now, and I won't let them fall without a fight. The orcs in hiding... They're family to me. Protecting them is more than just duty; it's everything.
[player]: I sense you're protecting something important. I give you my word - your secret is safe with me. What are you really guarding?
[red_fang_orc]: *grunts softly and shifts uncomfortably, looking around as if checking for threats* You've got a good heart, orc friend. But this... This can't go any further than the both of us know. The refugees are in my care now, and I won't let them down. Not even with your silent oath. Keep your eyes open tonight; there's more out there than meets the eye.
