[location trigger] The players approach the Northern Border Outpost with hands visible and non-threatening.
[npc trigger] Red Fang watches the approaching figures warily, weapon ready but not yet drawn.
[player]: Warrior, I come in peace. I mean no harm to you or this outpost.
[red_fang_orc]: Hmph. Stranger, show me what proof you bring that warrants my trust. Speak now or face the edge of my blade.
[player]: I respect your strength and your duty here. You guard this border with honor.
[red_fang_orc]: A grunt escapes my lips. I shift uneasily, keeping an eye on the door. Stranger, if you truly mean peace, then prove it. What brings a warrior like you to our humble outpost?
[player]: I understand your caution with strangers. These are dangerous times for everyone.
[red_fang_orc]: *Grumbles* Fine. I'll listen. But don't take this as a sign of weakness. You want info or aid? Prove it. No tricks, no lies.
[player]: You carry yourself like a protector, not just a guard. There's more to your duty than keeping borders, isn't there?
[red_fang_orc]: *Red_fang_orc shifts uncomfortably, eyes narrowing.* I've secrets of my own. Don't pry too deep, warrior. *Glances around suspiciously before lowering his voice.* My people... they hide here. Not far from this place. We're in danger, and we need help.
*He pauses, gauging the player's reaction.* Can you keep a secret?
[player]: I believe everyone has their reasons for the choices they make. What drives you to stand watch here?
[red_fang_orc]: The world outside is full of threats. I protect what's mine. My people... they need a champion, and that's me. *Fists clench tightly* If you can help us, show it now. Otherwise, keep your distance.
[player]: I sense you're protecting something important. I give you my word - your secret is safe with me. What are you really guarding?
[red_fang_orc]: *Red_fang_orc's eyes flicker with a mix of suspicion and guarded trust.* You've taken an oath, warrior. But remember, the forest is full of creatures that hunt in darkness. *He leans closer, whispering.* I protect my kin, those who cannot defend themselves. They hide in these mountains, away from prying eyes. If you can keep them safe, we might just find common ground.
*He stands up straighter and looks around again before continuing.* But don't think for a moment that I won't be watching you. *Gives the player a stern look.* Now, if you're truly here to help, prove it. What do you need from me?
