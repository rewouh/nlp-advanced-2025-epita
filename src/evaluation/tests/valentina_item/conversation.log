[location trigger] I enter the apothecary
[npc trigger] I approach Valentina Nightshade
[player]: Valentina, your knowledge of toxins and antidotes is unparalleled in this region.
[valentina_nightshade]: Indeed, I pride myself on my expertise. What can I assist you with tonight?
[player]: I've heard you can cure ailments that no other apothecary can treat.
[valentina_nightshade]: Ah, the whispers of a skilled hand. There are indeed certain remedies and antidotes that require a bit more... finesse. What ailment do you suffer from that others cannot help?
[player]: Your discretion is admirable. I imagine many seek your services for... delicate matters.
[valentina_nightshade]: Precise, as always. While my methods may be discreet, they are also highly effective. What brings such a discerning client to me tonight?
[player]: I'm investigating some suspicious deaths in town. Have you sold any unusual poisons recently?
[valentina_nightshade]: Ah, an investigator with keen eyes. I keep many secrets, but the curious always find their answers eventually. Can you enlighten me as to why these deaths caught your interest?
[player]: I'm venturing into dangerous areas where frost poison is common. I need protection.
[valentina_nightshade]: Very well. I can prepare a Frost Poison Antidote for you. It will cost you five gold pieces, and discretion is advised when using it. Understand the consequences of failure.
[player]: Can you provide me with an antidote? I have coin and discretion to match your own.
[valentina_nightshade]: Five gold pieces for the preparation, then. Ensure they are clean and pure. Use this wisely; a single mistake could be fatal. Here, take my Frost Poison Antidote. Keep it well hidden.
