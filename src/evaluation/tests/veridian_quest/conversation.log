[location trigger] The players enter the Velvet Emporium, surrounded by luxury goods.
[npc trigger] Lady Veridian looks up from examining a rare jewel and greets the visitors professionally.
[player]: Lady Veridian, I've heard you deal in rare and exceptional goods.
[lady_veridian]: Ah, indeed I do. What sort of treasures are stirring your curiosity tonight?
[player]: Your collection is impressive. You must have connections to acquire such treasures.
[lady_veridian]: Indeed, I have my ways. Connections and a bit of shrewdness go a long way in this world. And what brings you to inquire about my collections today?
[player]: I'm a skilled adventurer looking for work. Do you have need of someone with my abilities?
[lady_veridian]: Certainly, adventurers are always valuable. I've been thinking your skills could be put to use on an upcoming mission. Would you be interested in retrieving a rare artifact from the old ruins near Darkpeak Forest? It's not without danger, but the reward is substantial.
[player]: I specialize in retrieving difficult-to-find items from dangerous places.
[lady_veridian]: Excellent choice of words. The location you mentioned sounds perilous, yet the opportunity could prove rewarding indeed. Have you heard anything about recent activities around Darkpeak Forest? Might there be any particular challenges or dangers I should prepare for?
[player]: If you have any quests or tasks that require a capable professional, I'm at your service.
[lady_veridian]: I appreciate your offer, but the current situation is a bit tense. The Iron Vanguard is recruiting mercenaries for a dangerous mission tonight to secure supplies from the docks. It's urgent and requires skilled professionals like yourself.

In the meantime, if you're interested in any of my rare items or need supplies before taking on that mission, feel free to peruse my collection. I might have something that could aid your venture into Darkpeak Forest.
[player]: What kind of rare items are you currently seeking? I'd be honored to help you acquire them.
[lady_veridian]: Ah, a discerning eye like yours would appreciate such wonders. I'm in need of certain ingredients for a potion that can grant temporary invisibility—a valuable asset indeed. Additionally, a fragment from the Whispering Stone, which can provide insight into the future, might interest you.

Would you be able to assist me with these? The Iron Vanguard's mission might be too risky for me at this moment, but your expertise could be invaluable in acquiring these items.
