[location trigger] The players enter the Velvet Emporium, surrounded by luxury goods.
[npc trigger] Lady Veridian looks up from examining a rare jewel and greets the visitors professionally.
[player]: Lady Veridian, I've heard you deal in rare and exceptional goods.
[lady_veridian]: Indeed, I do have some unique items that might interest you. What sort of things are you looking for?
[player]: Your collection is impressive. You must have connections to acquire such treasures.
[lady_veridian]: Ah, the connections are many, forged through years of trade and a keen eye for opportunity. What treasure are you seeking today?
[player]: I'm a skilled adventurer looking for work. Do you have need of someone with my abilities?
[lady_veridian]: Certainly! I've heard about your prowess. There's a dangerous mission that requires a strong, resourceful individual like yourself. The Iron Vanguard is recruiting mercenaries for a task that could be quite lucrative. Would you be interested in such an assignment?
[player]: I specialize in retrieving difficult-to-find items from dangerous places.
[lady_veridian]: That sounds perfect. I have a proposition for you, but it involves venturing into the sewers where goblin raiders are known to hide. You might find valuable goods there, but beware of their traps and attacks. Are you up for the challenge?
[player]: If you have any quests or tasks that require a capable professional, I'm at your service.
[lady_veridian]: Very well, let me think on it for a moment. The Iron Vanguard is indeed looking for mercenaries, but there's another task that might interest you more directly. A scholar believes the Tome of Winter's End holds the key to stopping an eternal winter curse. It's hidden in the Ruins of the Old Temple, a place notorious for its dangers. Would you be willing to brave such peril?
[player]: What kind of rare items are you currently seeking? I'd be honored to help you acquire them.
[lady_veridian]: Ah, an offer well made. I'm indeed in search of a few rare artifacts: a crystal vial from the Luminous Caves, a piece of obsidian from the Shadow Mountains, and a peculiar feather said to belong to the elusive Snowwing bird. These items are crucial for my business ventures and would fetch a good price. Would you be willing to undertake such a quest?
