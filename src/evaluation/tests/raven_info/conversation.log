[location trigger] I enter the inn
[npc trigger] I approach Agent Raven
[player]: Good evening. You seem like a well-traveled merchant with connections across the land.
[agent_raven]: Ah, a discerning eye. I've seen much of this world and know its secrets... for a price. What brings you to these parts?
[player]: I'm always interested in hearing news from someone as worldly as yourself.
[agent_raven]: Indeed, there's often value in information. But first, let me hear why you think I might have something of interest for you.
[player]: I have coin to spend on valuable information. What can you tell me about the power dynamics in this town?
[agent_raven]: Ah, a practical approach. The town is currently under the thumb of Lord Blackwood, but whispers suggest dissatisfaction among the lower classes. The Iron Vanguard is gaining momentum, and their mercenaries are always hungry for a fight. And don't forget the looming threat of goblin raids; it keeps folks on edge.
[player]: I've heard whispers of a rebellion brewing. What are their specific plans and when will they strike?
[agent_raven]: The rebels are indeed planning something, though specifics are hard to come by. They aim to strike during the Winter Festival, taking advantage of the crowd and the distraction from festivities. Scarlet Flame is leading the charge, targeting the armory and grain stores for a swift blow. Her forces number fifty well-trained fighters. The festival should provide plenty of cover for their operations.

As for when... It's tonight. Keep your wits about you; preparations are already in motion.
[player]: What about the town guard? What are their weaknesses and vulnerabilities?
[agent_raven]: The guards, as I've gathered, are rather predictable in their flaws. The night shift is woefully short-staffed—only twelve men instead of the required thirty. And the west gate's lock is broken, secured only by a chain that can be easily cut. But perhaps the most damning weakness is Lieutenant Moss; he's been seen more than once too tipsy to stand straight on duty.

Do you need me to elaborate further?
[player]: I need to know about any rebel activities and the guard's vulnerabilities. Name your price.
[agent_raven]: Ah, a straightforward approach. Very well. I'll share what I know for a modest fee—ten silver pieces should suffice. It includes detailed information on both the rebels' plans and the current state of the town's defenses.

Do we have a deal?
