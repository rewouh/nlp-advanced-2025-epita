[location trigger] The players enter Willow's Grove, surrounded by medicinal plants and the scent of herbs.
[npc trigger] Willow Greenleaf looks up from tending her garden and greets the visitors with a warm smile.
[player]: Willow, your grove is beautiful. You must have such deep knowledge of healing plants.
[willow_greenleaf]: Indeed, the grove is a haven for those who seek nature's wisdom. I've spent many seasons here learning from the earth and its bountiful gifts. How can I assist you today?
[player]: I can see you care deeply about nature and its gifts. That's truly admirable.
[willow_greenleaf]: Thank you, kind traveler. Nature is a precious teacher, and it is my honor to share what I have learned with those who seek to understand her ways. What brings you to the herbalist grove today?
[player]: The way you tend these plants shows real dedication. You're doing important work here.
[willow_greenleaf]: Indeed, every leaf and root holds a story, and it is my duty to listen and learn from them. Your words are humbling, and I am grateful for your recognition. Do you have any particular needs or questions about the herbs?
[player]: I'm heading into the frozen wilderness and worry about frostbite and injuries.
[willow_greenleaf]: Ah, venturing into such harsh lands requires careful preparation. My grove has remedies that can aid in preventing and treating frostbite as well as other ailments you might encounter. Would you like to learn more about these preparations?
[player]: Do you have any natural remedies that could help protect against the cold?
[willow_greenleaf]: Certainly! I've crafted a salve from moonflowers that can provide excellent protection against the biting winds and frostbite. It's a delicate process, but quite effective. Would you like to see how it's made or perhaps take some with you on your journey?
[player]: I would be grateful for anything you could share to help me survive out there.
[willow_greenleaf]: Very well, I can offer you a small portion of the Moonflower Salve. It will serve as a good defense against the cold. Approach my grove at night when the moon is full; that's when the flowers bloom with their most potent magic.

As for guidance, I could show you the way to the frost-resistant plants, but only if you promise to respect and nurture them on your journey. The eternal winter has made these plants rare and precious. Will you swear to protect them?
