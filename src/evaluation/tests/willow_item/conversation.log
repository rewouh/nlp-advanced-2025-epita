[location trigger] The players enter Willow's Grove, surrounded by medicinal plants and the scent of herbs.
[npc trigger] Willow Greenleaf looks up from tending her garden and greets the visitors with a warm smile.
[player]: Willow, your grove is beautiful. You must have such deep knowledge of healing plants.
[willow_greenleaf]: Thank you for the compliment. My grove holds many secrets, and indeed, I've spent a lifetime studying how to heal with nature's gifts. How can I assist you today?
[player]: I can see you care deeply about nature and its gifts. That's truly admirable.
[willow_greenleaf]: Thank you for your kind words. Nature is my life, and it guides me in everything I do. Is there something specific you're seeking knowledge about, or perhaps a particular ailment that needs tending?
[player]: The way you tend these plants shows real dedication. You're doing important work here.
[willow_greenleaf]: Indeed, every plant has its story to tell, and listening to them is both a privilege and a responsibility. If you have any questions or need guidance on healing with the herbs, I would be honored to help in any way I can.
[player]: I'm heading into the frozen wilderness and worry about frostbite and injuries.
[willow_greenleaf]: With the eternal winter, proper preparation is crucial. Do you bring my grove's protective salves? They should offer some relief against the harsh cold. Let me show you which ones to use.
[player]: Do you have any natural remedies that could help protect against the cold?
[willow_greenleaf]: Of course, I do have remedies that can provide a bit of extra protection against the biting cold. My grove is well-stocked with plants that thrive in such conditions. Let me gather some of my finest protective salves and poultices for you. We'll need to hurry; it's getting quite late.
[player]: I would be grateful for anything you could share to help me survive out there.
[willow_greenleaf]: Of course, I'll prepare a small kit for you. It includes not just my protective salves but also some warming herbs and antifreeze potions that should keep you as warm as possible in these cold climes. Let's get started before it gets any darker.
