[location trigger] I enter the collection office
[npc trigger] I approach Viktor the Collector
[player]: Viktor, you're known as a fair but thorough professional. I respect that about you.
[viktor_the_collector]: Thank you for the compliment. Fairness is important, but thoroughness ensures justice is served. How may I assist you today?
[player]: Your knowledge of everyone's financial situation must be comprehensive.
[viktor_the_collector]: Indeed, it is essential to have a clear understanding of one's clients' and debtors' standings. It allows me to maintain order and ensure that debts are settled promptly. Is there something specific you're curious about or in need of?
[player]: I'm looking to invest in local businesses. I need to know who's truly solvent and who's failing.
[viktor_the_collector]: That sounds like a prudent approach. I can provide you with an overview of the financial health of various merchants, but it comes at a price—100 gold pieces for your investment report. Would you like to proceed?
[player]: Which merchants are actually bankrupt but pretending otherwise? I don't want to invest in failures.
[viktor_the_collector]: Understandable caution. However, revealing that information would compromise my integrity and could have serious repercussions. Perhaps you might consider the terms of our previous agreement for a more detailed report. Alternatively, if you trust me completely, perhaps we can come to another arrangement.
[player]: What about the nobles? I've heard rumors that some are secretly poor despite appearances.
[viktor_the_collector]: The nobility is a delicate matter. Accusations without proof could be... detrimental. However, if you're willing to make a substantial investment, I might consider providing you with an overview of their financial situations. It would cost 200 gold pieces, as the information involves deeper inquiries and risks. Do you have any specific nobles in mind?
[player]: Tell me about the financial situation of the merchants and nobles. Who's really in trouble?
[viktor_the_collector]: I can offer you a general overview without specifics, but if you're willing to invest 300 gold pieces, I could provide you with detailed reports on the financial standings of the merchants and nobility you're interested in. Would that be agreeable?
