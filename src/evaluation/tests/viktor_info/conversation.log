[location trigger] I enter the collection office
[npc trigger] I approach Viktor the Collector
[player]: Viktor, you're known as a fair but thorough professional. I respect that about you.
[viktor_the_collector]: Thank you for your words. Fairness is key in my dealings, though thoroughness can sometimes be mistaken for stubbornness. What brings you to the collection office tonight?
[player]: Your knowledge of everyone's financial situation must be comprehensive.
[viktor_the_collector]: Indeed, my ledger keeps track of many debts. It's a matter of maintaining order and ensuring justice is served. Care to know if any particular debt interests you?
[player]: I'm looking to invest in local businesses. I need to know who's truly solvent and who's failing.
[viktor_the_collector]: I can provide that information, but it comes with a price. You'll need to cover my fees for such a detailed inquiry. Would you like me to start with a specific merchant or noble?
[player]: Which merchants are actually bankrupt but pretending otherwise? I don't want to invest in failures.
[viktor_the_collector]: I understand your concern, but remember that information is power—and it has its cost. Merchant Torvin of the Silk Road Traders is indeed hiding his bankruptcy with fake invoices. He's a tricky one, always staying just ahead of creditors. Would you like me to look into others as well?
[player]: What about the nobles? I've heard rumors that some are secretly poor despite appearances.
[viktor_the_collector]: Baron Wintermere has sold all his family heirlooms and is now 20,000 gold in debt. Count Frostborn's estate is at risk; he's three months away from losing everything. These nobles are more complex than they appear on the surface. Would you like to know about any others? Each inquiry will require payment for my efforts.
[player]: Tell me about the financial situation of the merchants and nobles. Who's really in trouble?
[viktor_the_collector]: Merchant Torvin of the Silk Road Traders is bankrupt but masking it with false invoices, making him a risky investment. Baron Wintermere has already sold off his family treasures to cover debts totaling 20,000 gold. Count Frostborn’s estate faces imminent peril; he's just three months away from losing everything due to mounting liabilities.

Would you like me to look into any others? Each inquiry will come with a fee for my services.
