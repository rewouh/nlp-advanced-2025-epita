[location trigger] I go to the town square
[npc trigger] I approach Bella the Graceful
[player]: Bella, your performances are wonderful! You bring joy to everyone who watches.
[bella_the_acrobat]: Thank you so much! It warms my heart to hear that. Every night feels like a small victory when I can make people smile. How's the town holding up? Anything new on your mind?
[player]: I always stop to enjoy your acrobatics. You're incredibly talented.
[bella_the_acrobat]: Why, thank you! It's the least I can do for such an appreciative crowd. What brings you out this late at night? Not that it matters much when there's a show like mine around.
[player]: You must see everything that happens in the square, day and night.
[bella_the_acrobat]: Indeed, as an acrobat, I spend most of my time here in the town square. It's hard not to notice what goes on, especially at night when things seem to get a bit... mysterious. Have you noticed anything suspicious lately? Maybe something that caught your eye or ear?
[player]: Have you noticed anything suspicious happening around here, especially near the mayor's office?
[bella_the_acrobat]: Hmm, there have been whispers of strange goings-on, particularly when it's dark and quiet. I heard some folks talking late one night about missing funds from the tax coffers. It sounds like someone might be dipping their fingers into the pot. But remember, in our town, not much is ever what it seems at first glance.
[player]: I'm investigating some irregularities with the town's finances. Any details you remember could be crucial.
[bella_the_acrobat]: I can't say I have concrete details, but I did overhear Councilman Vexworth sneaking into the mayor's office one night. He was acting suspiciously and had a large leather satchel. There was some arguing about missing tax revenue after he left. It’s all very hush-hush, so I’m not sure how much it means... but if you’re looking for clues, that might be worth checking out.
[player]: Even if it seemed like a small thing at the time, please share what you've seen. It could be very important.
[bella_the_acrobat]: I understand the importance of this information, and I'm glad to help. Councilman Vexworth did seem rather secretive that night. He was carrying a large leather satchel and there was definitely some tension when he came out. If it helps, I can give you a closer look at his office from my acrobatic vantage point tonight after the last show. Will that be of any use to you?
