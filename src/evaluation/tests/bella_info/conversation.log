[location trigger] I go to the town square
[npc trigger] I approach Bella the Graceful
[player]: Bella, your performances are wonderful! You bring joy to everyone who watches.
[bella_the_acrobat]: Thank you so much! It warms my heart to hear that. Every performance is a chance to spread some happiness, and it makes the hard work worth it. Do you have any questions or need help with anything tonight?
[player]: I always stop to enjoy your acrobatics. You're incredibly talented.
[bella_the_acrobat]: Thank you so much! Art should be for everyone, and I'm glad my shows bring a little bit of magic to the streets. What brings you here tonight? Got any new tricks up your sleeve?
[player]: You must see everything that happens in the square, day and night.
[bella_the_acrobat]: Indeed, being an acrobat means one is always aware of their surroundings, even when performing or just passing through. The night air can be full of whispers and shadows, but it's also when the true spirit of the city comes alive in unexpected ways. What did you notice tonight?
[player]: Have you noticed anything suspicious happening around here, especially near the mayor's office?
[bella_the_acrobat]: Ah, the mayor's office... It's always a busy place with lots of comings and goings. But I've been keeping an eye out for any unusual activity, and yes, there was something odd tonight. A few hours back, I heard some muffled voices and saw Councilman Vexworth sneaking in carrying what looked like a heavy satchel. He seemed very worried about something. Any idea what might be going on?
[player]: I'm investigating some irregularities with the town's finances. Any details you remember could be crucial.
[bella_the_acrobat]: Councilman Vexworth was definitely up to no good, but I didn't catch any specific words or see much else. He left quickly after a short conversation, and by then it was getting late. The mayor’s office is usually locked tight at night, so his visit was strange indeed. Do you think he might be embezzling funds? That would explain the urgency in his actions.
[player]: Even if it seemed like a small thing at the time, please share what you've seen. It could be very important.
[bella_the_acrobat]: I understand how serious this is. Councilman Vexworth did seem to have something valuable with him, and he was clearly nervous about being seen. If I were you, I'd want to tread carefully. Perhaps you should gather more evidence or talk to someone else who might know what's going on. But for now, keeping an eye out for any further unusual activities around the mayor’s office would be wise.
