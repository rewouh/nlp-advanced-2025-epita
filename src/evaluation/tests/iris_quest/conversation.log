[location trigger] The players enter Iris's Cartography Shop, maps covering every wall.
[npc trigger] Iris Mapmaker looks up from her work and greets the visitors with a friendly smile.
[player]: Iris, your maps are incredibly detailed. This is masterful cartography work.
[iris_mapmaker]: Thank you, kind traveler. I strive for perfection in every line and detail. Have you a specific map or region that interests you?
[player]: Having accurate maps can save lives. Your work is truly valuable.
[iris_mapmaker]: Indeed, precise mapping ensures safe journeys and secure trade routes. If there's any area where you think a detailed map could make a difference, I'd be happy to assist in creating one. What regions are troubling you most?
[player]: I'm an experienced explorer with a good sense of direction and keen observation.
[iris_mapmaker]: That sounds like a valuable skill set. With your experience, we might uncover some hidden gems or overlooked dangers on the map. Are there any particular areas you've found intriguing but lacked proper mapping?
[player]: I imagine there are still areas that haven't been properly mapped yet.
[iris_mapmaker]: Indeed, there are always new territories to explore and chart. Have you come across any such regions recently? Perhaps we could collaborate on a map of those uncharted lands.
[player]: I'd be interested in helping you fill in the blank spaces on your charts.
[iris_mapmaker]: That sounds like an excellent proposition, traveler. Let's discuss which areas might benefit most from your expertise and my cartographic skills. Perhaps we could start with the northern tundra where rumors of strange phenomena have been reported?
[player]: What unexplored regions need mapping? I'm ready to venture into dangerous territory for your work.
[iris_mapmaker]: The northern tundra, you mentioned it! It's a treacherous place, covered in dense fog and icy mists. Few maps truly capture its harsh terrain and the peculiarities of that climate. We could start there, but be warned, rumors speak of both hidden resources and... less friendly inhabitants.

Do you think you're up for such an adventure?
