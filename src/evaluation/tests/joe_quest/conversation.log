[location trigger] The players enter the tavern, the atmosphere warm and inviting.
[npc trigger] Joe the tavern keeper looks up and greets the newcomers with a nod.
[player]: Joe, you seem like someone who knows what's happening in this town.
[joe_tavernier]: Ah, a newcomer to these parts? I suppose you could say I've seen more than my fair share of sailing and storms. People come and go, but I stick around. What brings you to the Rusty Anchor tonight?
[player]: I'm an adventurer looking for work. Are there any problems around here that need solving?
[joe_tavernier]: *Grumbles* Well, if you're itching for trouble, the Iron Vanguard is offering bounties for mercenaries. Not exactly a noble cause, but it pays well. And don't ignore those strange sounds coming from the lighthouse—some say they can hear voices there at night. But beware, no one knows what might be out in the deeps that listen.

Curious about those goblin raids? I've got my suspicions, and I'm looking for someone to dig around in the sewers. Maybe you could be the one?
[player]: A tavern keeper usually hears about all sorts of troubles. Anything going on that needs attention?
[joe_tavernier]: *Sighs* Tales of trouble are as common here as salt in the air. But if you're looking for something to stir up, why don't you check out those strange noises from the lighthouse? *Glances suspiciously around* And keep an eye on the docks—if I had to guess, it's not just the goblins raiding the northern farms; there might be more going on.
[player]: I'm skilled at handling dangerous situations. If there's any trouble in the area, I can help.
[joe_tavernier]: *Nods* Skilled or not, the Iron Vanguard could use your kind of muscle. They're recruiting at the keep barracks this morning. As for those goblin raids... *Pauses, glancing towards the door* Better to be prepared than sorry, wouldn't you say? Keep an eye on the docks; there's a secret tunnel behind the bar that leads down to them.
[player]: Have you heard of any issues with thieves, bandits, or creatures causing problems?
[joe_tavernier]: *Stirs the ashes in the fireplace* Thieves and bandits are always a nuisance, but they're usually easy enough to deal with. It's those underground whispers that keep me up at night. *Leans forward* There's talk of something sinister down by the docks, but not many want to risk their necks to find out what it is.
[player]: I'd be happy to take care of any pest problems or investigate suspicious activities for you.
[joe_tavernier]: *Grumbles* Well, if you're set on being a hero, start with the lighthouse first. Those sounds... they don't sound natural. And keep an eye out for anything amiss around here. *Pauses* As for the docks, there's a secret tunnel behind the bar that might hold some answers. You can use it to check things out without drawing too much attention. But be careful—there's more than just goblins down there.
