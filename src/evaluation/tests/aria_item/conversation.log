[location trigger] The players enter the Moonlight Apothecary, the scent of herbs welcoming them.
[npc trigger] Aria Silvermoon looks up from grinding herbs and smiles warmly at the visitors.
[player]: Good day, Aria. Your apothecary has such a welcoming atmosphere.
[aria_silvermoon]: Thank you for the compliment! I strive to make everyone feel at home when they're seeking relief or knowledge here. What brings you by today?
[player]: The care you put into your remedies is evident. You must help so many people.
[aria_silvermoon]: Indeed, helping those in need fills my heart with joy. But there's always more to do. How can I assist you today?
[player]: It's rare to find someone so dedicated to healing others. Your kindness is admirable.
[aria_silvermoon]: Thank you for your kind words. It's a small price to pay, knowing that I might make even the darkest days a little brighter. What brings you by today? Is there anything in particular you're seeking?
[player]: I'm heading into dangerous territory soon, and I'm worried about getting injured far from help.
[aria_silvermoon]: I understand your concern, traveler. It's wise to be prepared. Do you have any specific ailments or injuries that worry you the most? I might have some remedies or supplies that could help.
[player]: Your potions could truly save lives out there. Do you have any healing remedies you could spare?
[aria_silvermoon]: Certainly, my friend. While I can't give everything away, I do have a few potent remedies that should serve well in your travels. Let me see what we have on hand. [She rummages through her shelves and pulls out a small vial of shimmering green liquid, a salve wrapped in soft cloth, and a pouch filled with herbs.] These should help with common injuries and ailments. Take good care!
[player]: I would be incredibly grateful for any help you could provide. Your generosity would mean everything.
[aria_silvermoon]: Aria Sighs gently, placing the remedies into your hands. "You're too kind, but it's my duty to share what I can. These should see you through most emergencies." She offers a warm smile. "Be safe on your journey."
