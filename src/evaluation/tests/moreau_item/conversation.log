[location trigger] I enter the quarantine ward
[npc trigger] I approach Dr. Moreau
[player]: Hello Dr. Moreau, I've heard about your incredible work treating the frost plague.
[dr_moreau]: Ah, thank you for the kind words. The frost sickness is a formidable foe, and every treatment is a step forward in understanding its nature. How can I assist you tonight?
[player]: The town is lucky to have someone so dedicated to helping the sick. How are your patients doing?
[dr_moreau]: The progress is slow but steady. Each case presents unique challenges, much like the frost sickness itself. Our latest batch of treatments shows promise, though we must remain cautious and thorough in our approach.
[player]: I'm concerned about the frost plague. Is there anything that can protect someone from catching it?
[dr_moreau]: The frost plague is indeed insidious. At present, our best defenses lie in avoiding direct contact with infected individuals and maintaining strict hygiene practices. I am working on a preventative measure, but its efficacy remains to be seen until more trials are conducted. Would you like me to review some basic precautions we can take together?
[player]: I'd be grateful if you could provide me with some of your cure, in case I encounter the plague.
[dr_moreau]: *Dr. Moreau's expression darkens as he considers the request.*

Certainly, but it must remain between us. This treatment is still experimental and requires careful administration. Let me show you what to look for and how to use it if needed. Follow these instructions closely.

*He hands over a small vial and a pamphlet with detailed instructions.*
