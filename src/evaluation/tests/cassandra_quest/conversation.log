[location trigger] I visit the treasure vault
[npc trigger] I approach Cassandra Vale
[player]: Cassandra, your collection of ancient relics is impressive. You're a skilled treasure hunter.
[cassandra_vale]: Thank you for the compliment. I wouldn't have it any other way. The world is full of secrets waiting to be uncovered, and some of those treasures can fetch quite a price. Careful though—some of these relics come with more than just gold.
[player]: I admire your bravery exploring dangerous tombs and ruins.
[cassandra_vale]: Bravery? Me? I'm more about the treasure, really. But hey, danger makes for good stories—and better profits. What brings you to the Rusty Anchor today?
[player]: I'm an experienced adventurer looking for profitable expeditions.
[cassandra_vale]: Ah, a kindred spirit then. The Iron Vanguard is recruiting mercenaries for a mission that could be quite lucrative. They're after some ancient artifacts said to hold untold power. Interested in joining up?
[player]: What treasure hunts do you have planned? I can help you raid tombs and recover artifacts.
[cassandra_vale]: Well, well, an eager partner. Let's see... there are a few tombs that haven't been fully explored yet. The one near the Whispering Woods is said to hold some interesting relics. Of course, it's guarded by all manner of traps and who knows what else. What do you say? We could split the haul or take turns picking the best pieces.
