[location trigger] I visit the exile manor
[npc trigger] I approach Duchess Ashara
[player]: Duchess Ashara, your exile from your homeland is a grave injustice.
[duchess_ashara]: Indeed, it is an affront to both my dignity and the rightful legacy of House Ashara. But in exile, one must find new allies and bide their time wisely. What brings you to speak of such matters?
[player]: Someone of your noble bearing doesn't deserve to live in isolation like this.
[duchess_ashara]: The world has a way of reminding nobles that their status is fragile. Perhaps we can find common ground, or at least mutual benefit, through our shared plight. What do you propose?
[player]: I can see the pain in your eyes. I want to help restore your honor.
[duchess_ashara]: Thank you for your sincerity, but remember, those who seek to help often become pawns in my game. What makes you think you're not just another piece on my board?
[player]: Tell me about your homeland and what truly happened. I want to understand the injustice you suffered.
[duchess_ashara]: My homeland... a place of ancient forests, rolling hills, and proud castles. It was meant to be a realm where justice and nobility reigned supreme. But behind its grand facade lay deceit and betrayal.

King Aldric VII, the man who now sits on my throne, is not the true heir but a bastard son of the former queen's illicit affair with the court mage. The real prince, Cassius, was murdered on his eighteenth birthday by the spymaster himself—sent to silence any claim to the crown. It is a web of lies and shadows that I alone have uncovered.

When the truth came to light, the king moved swiftly to silence all who might expose him. My family was among the first to fall. Exiled from our lands, we were left to rot in this forsaken manor, while he reigned as if he had a divine right to rule.
[player]: What secrets do you know about the kingdom that exiled you? The truth should be revealed.
[duchess_ashara]: The truth is a bitter pill to swallow, but it must be shared for justice to have any chance of prevailing. King Aldric VII's treasury is empty, relying on loans from foreign banks to keep his reign afloat. Meanwhile, the true heir, Prince Cassius, was murdered by the spymaster, ensuring that the false king could maintain control without challenge.

These secrets were uncovered through a series of clandestine investigations and sacrifices. I fear they are the reason for my exile—knowledge that cannot be silenced. Will you use them to help clear my name and reclaim what is rightfully ours?
[player]: What can I do to help clear your name or assist in your cause for revenge?
[duchess_ashara]: The path to justice is fraught with danger, but if you are truly committed to uncovering the truth, there are a few steps we could take. First, gather any information about the current state of the kingdom—its finances, military strength, and the loyalty of its people. Then, we need to find allies among those who remember the true prince or have been affected by the king's corruption.

And if you're willing to risk your life for this cause, perhaps together we can infiltrate the court, gather more evidence, and expose the false king's lies to the world. Are you prepared for such peril?
