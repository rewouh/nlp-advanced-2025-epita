[location trigger] I visit the exile manor
[npc trigger] I approach Duchess Ashara
[player]: Duchess Ashara, your exile from your homeland is a grave injustice.
[duchess_ashara]: Tsk. Justice? In this world, it's as elusive as the moonlight in these forest glades. I'm here to clear my name and reclaim what is rightfully mine. Your words do little to comfort me; they remind me of the truth that lies beyond these walls.
[player]: Someone of your noble bearing doesn't deserve to live in isolation like this.
[duchess_ashara]: Isolation, you say? Perhaps it suits me better than the false king's court ever did. My presence here is a testament to my resolve and my need for caution. But that does not change the fact that I seek justice and vengeance. What can you offer me that would make me reconsider my position?
[player]: I can see the pain in your eyes. I want to help restore your honor.
[duchess_ashara]: Ah, well-intentioned words from a stranger. Yet, it is not merely my honor that needs restoration; it's an entire kingdom's truth. How do you propose to topple the false king and his loyalists? More importantly, how can you ensure I won't end up in this same exile again once you've succeeded?
[player]: Tell me about your homeland and what truly happened. I want to understand the injustice you suffered.
[duchess_ashara]: My homeland... it was a place of beauty and intrigue, shrouded by the dense forests and the ever-present whispers of magic. The true story is far from what history records—King Aldric VII, who sits upon the throne now, is not our rightful king at all. He's the bastard son of the former queen, sired by a court mage during her reign. That truth was concealed by the false king and his loyalists.

The real heir, Prince Cassius, was murdered on his eighteenth birthday by the spymaster. The crime went unpunished because the false king had control over the courts and the people's minds. My own father, Lord Rylar, was implicated in the conspiracy to keep me from claiming my birthright. It was a web of deceit spun so tightly that even those closest to me were ensnared.

The kingdom is now in turmoil, dependent on foreign banks and teetering on the brink of collapse. But fear not, I am not without allies—Prince Cassius' loyalists still exist, plotting from the shadows. They are waiting for a chance to bring down the false king and restore our rightful rule.
[player]: What secrets do you know about the kingdom that exiled you? The truth should be revealed.
[duchess_ashara]: The truth... it's like peeling back layers of a rotting onion, each layer more bitter than the last. You see, the royal treasury is empty, drained by years of extravagance and mismanagement under the false king. To keep the kingdom from collapsing entirely, we've been borrowing heavily from foreign banks, which now have their fingers in our financial pie. It's a precarious position at best.

But there’s more. Prince Cassius, my brother—our true heir—was murdered on his eighteenth birthday by the spymaster, who was under the false king’s control. The murder was meant to silence him and secure the throne for Aldric VII. My father, Lord Rylar, was framed and exiled for this crime, though in truth, he had nothing to do with it.

These secrets were kept hidden by the false king's lies and propaganda. Only now, as I sit here in exile, can I begin to piece together what truly happened. And when the time is right, they will be used to bring down the false king and reclaim our rightful throne.
[player]: What can I do to help clear your name or assist in your cause for revenge?
[duchess_ashara]: You have a noble heart, but be wary of those who might lead you astray. The path to justice is fraught with danger. If you truly wish to aid me, gather any information on the false king's misdeeds and the foreign bankers who now control our purse strings. Also, keep an eye out for signs of rebellion among Cassius' loyalists; they are your best hope in overturning this unjust reign.

But remember, trust is a fragile thing. Only those I truly believe in can be trusted with my secrets.
