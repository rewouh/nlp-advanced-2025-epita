[location trigger] I visit the monastery ruins
[npc trigger] I approach Master Wei
[player]: Master Wei, I seek wisdom and inner peace. Your discipline is inspiring.
[master_oakenheart]: Ah, seeker of tranquility. Discipline in shipbuilding does bring order to the chaos of sea. What brings a land dweller like yourself to the docks?
[player]: I wish to learn the ways of meditation and martial balance. Will you teach me?
[master_oakenheart]: Meditation and martial arts, eh? Those are skills for the body and mind. While I know not much about them, perhaps we could find someone who can guide you better. The old monk at the temple might have what you seek.
[player]: Have you had visions about ending the eternal winter? What did they reveal?
[master_oakenheart]: Eternal winter, you say? Visions of such matters are rare indeed. They came to me in dreams, whispering of a vessel forged from titanium and enchanted with the heart of a dragon. It was said this ship could break through ice as if it were paper. But such knowledge is best kept hidden, for not all eyes should see what lies beneath the waves.
[player]: I've heard of ancient meditation techniques that grant visions. Can you teach me these practices?
[master_oakenheart]: Meditation and inner vision are arts unto themselves, much like crafting a ship's hull from oak to pine. They require time and dedication. If you truly seek such wisdom, perhaps we should start with the basics—breathing exercises and mindfulness, if you will.

Would you be willing to learn these simple techniques?
[player]: The path to enlightenment calls to me. I'm ready to dedicate myself to your teachings.
[master_oakenheart]: Very well, seeker. Let us begin our journey together then. First, we must clear your mind of all clutter—settle into a comfortable position and close your eyes. Take a deep breath in through your nose, hold it for a moment, and exhale slowly through your mouth. Repeat this three times.
[player]: Please, share your knowledge with me. I would be honored to receive one of your meditation scrolls.
[master_oakenheart]: Honor is a noble sentiment, but such teachings are sacred and not easily bestowed upon just any student. You must prove your worthiness through actions first. Show me what you have learned so far, and then we shall see if the stars align for you to learn my ways.
