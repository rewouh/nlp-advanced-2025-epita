[location trigger] I approach the necromancer tower
[npc trigger] I speak to Mordecai Shadowbind
[player]: Mordecai Shadowbind, your mastery of death magic is legendary among those who know.
[mordecai_shadowbind]: Ah, whispers of power always find their way back to me. What brings such a curious mind to seek out the Master of Death?
[player]: I'm not afraid of forbidden knowledge. I seek to understand the mysteries of death.
[mordecai_shadowbind]: Death is but a shadow in the corners of my vision. To truly understand it, one must embrace its cold touch. What secrets do you bring to our meeting tonight?
[player]: The power you wield over life and death fascinates me. I want to learn.
[mordecai_shadowbind]: Fascination can be a dangerous master in the realm of necromancy. What brings such an interest to your doorstep, stranger?
[player]: Tell me, how does one raise the dead permanently? I must know this dark secret.
[mordecai_shadowbind]: Raising the dead is no simple task, and it requires a deep understanding of the soul's journey beyond life. You will need a powerful heart's blood, a rare herb that blooms only in the shadowed realm, and an ancient tome filled with forbidden words. But remember, each soul you bind to your will grows stronger and more resentful, feeding on the dark energies you channel. Are you prepared for such a burden?
