[location trigger] I approach the necromancer tower
[npc trigger] I speak to Mordecai Shadowbind
[player]: Mordecai Shadowbind, your mastery of death magic is legendary among those who know.
[mordecai_shadowbind]: *A flicker of pride dances across my face as I lean forward slightly.* Indeed, the secrets of the dead are mine to command. But be wary, for not all seek to learn these arts for good.
[player]: I'm not afraid of forbidden knowledge. I seek to understand the mysteries of death.
[mordecai_shadowbind]: *My eyes narrow, studying you intently. The air around me seems to grow colder.* Very well, stranger. If you wish to delve into the dark arts, let us begin. But know this: the path is fraught with peril and代价可能是巨大的。你准备好了吗？
[player]: The power you wield over life and death fascinates me. I want to learn.
[mordecai_shadowbind]: *My lips curl into a cold smile.* The fascination of the unknown can be both a guide and a trap. Are you prepared to face what lies beyond the veil? Only the bravest—or the most foolhardy—venture into the shadowlands seeking knowledge.
[player]: Tell me, how does one raise the dead permanently? I must know this dark secret.
[mordecai_shadowbind]: *My eyes gleam with a mixture of admiration and caution as I observe you.* The process is... intricate, to say the least. It requires not just knowledge, but a willingness to sacrifice much. A life for a life, if you will. Are you willing to pay such a price?
