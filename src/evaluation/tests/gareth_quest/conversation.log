[location trigger] I approach the palace gates
[npc trigger] I speak to Sir Gareth Ironshield
[player]: Sir Gareth, your dedication to duty is exemplary. A true knight.
[sir_gareth]: Thank you for the kind words. My duty is not just to the title but to the realm and its people. May our paths cross again when I can truly serve.
[player]: The realm is fortunate to have someone of your honor protecting the palace.
[sir_gareth]: *Nods, a hint of pride in my voice.* The safety of the realm is paramount, and I strive to uphold that duty with every breath.
[player]: I'm a capable warrior. If there are threats to the nobility, I can help.
[sir_gareth]: Your skills would be invaluable, but for now, let us ensure the palace gates remain secure. *Looks around cautiously* The safety of our lord and lady depends on it.
[player]: What missions or quests can I undertake to serve the lord and protect the realm?
[sir_gareth]: The Iron Vanguard is recruiting mercenaries for a dangerous mission to clear out a bandit camp in the northern woods, not far from where goblin raids have been reported. It would test your mettle and ensure our borders remain safe.

Additionally, there's talk of strange activity around the lighthouse on the coast. Some fear it might be a signal for an impending raid or worse. I will need someone reliable to investigate that tonight, if you're willing to take on such a task.

Which do you think suits your skills better?
