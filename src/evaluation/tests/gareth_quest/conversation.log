[location trigger] I approach the palace gates
[npc trigger] I speak to Sir Gareth Ironshield
[player]: Sir Gareth, your dedication to duty is exemplary. A true knight.
[sir_gareth]: Thank you, sir. It is my sworn duty to protect and serve with honor. May I ask what brings you to the Rusty Anchor tonight?
[player]: The realm is fortunate to have someone of your honor protecting the palace.
[sir_gareth]: Indeed, the safety of our kingdom depends on the vigilance of its protectors. What news do you bring that concerns the palace?
[player]: I'm a capable warrior. If there are threats to the nobility, I can help.
[sir_gareth]: That is commendable. However, my duties require me to first confirm any potential threats within the palace walls. Can you assist by investigating the dock area where a mysterious stranger arrived this morning?
[player]: Have you heard of any specific plots against Lord Pemberton? Assassination attempts perhaps?
[sir_gareth]: Indeed, I have been made aware of an assassination plot. The Shadow Hand assassin guild has placed a contract for 50,000 gold to eliminate Lord Pemberton during the upcoming Winter Ball. A servant within the palace will be bribed to place poison in his wine glass. Vigilance is paramount, and I am closely monitoring all potential threats.
[player]: Are there any threats you're tracking that I could help investigate?
[sir_gareth]: I appreciate your willingness to assist, but for now, focus on the dock area. A stranger has arrived, and we need to ensure no suspicious activities are occurring. Once that is secured, perhaps then we can expand our search. Trust me, every precaution is necessary in these times.
[player]: What missions or quests can I undertake to serve the lord and protect the realm?
[sir_gareth]: The realm always needs brave hearts like yours. For now, focus on securing the palace gates and ensuring all incoming visitors are vetted thoroughly. The stranger you've noted at the docks is a priority.

If you wish to assist further, consider patrolling the northern perimeter of the castle grounds. There have been reports of unusual activity that could indicate a scouting party for an impending threat. Additionally, I would appreciate any information you can gather from the townsfolk regarding recent strange occurrences or sightings.

Once these immediate concerns are addressed, we may discuss more specific missions. For now, your vigilance is crucial in maintaining the safety and order of the realm.
