[location trigger] The players arrive at the Iron Keep Barracks.
[npc trigger] Captain Hilda Ironforge looks up from her tactical map and greets the newcomers with a nod.
[player]: Captain Ironforge, it's an honor to meet you. I've heard tales of your bravery in the Frost Giant wars.
[captain_hilda]: Ah, spare me the gallantry, soldier. We all do what we must for our people. What brings you here tonight?
[player]: The town seems well-protected under your command. Your dedication to these people must be unwavering.
[captain_hilda]: Indeed, it's a heavy burden I bear. But protecting the innocent is my duty. And I wouldn't have it any other way. So, what news do you bring?
[player]: I imagine leading the guard during these difficult times requires both strength and wisdom. How do you manage it all?
[captain_hilda]: Managing this role is a constant challenge, but maintaining discipline among my men and keeping a sharp eye on our defenses helps. It's not just about the physical battles; it's also about keeping morale high and ensuring everyone knows their place in these troubled times.
[player]: Your experience in battle must give you unique insights into what's happening in our region.
[captain_hilda]: True, every skirmish teaches me something new. The Frost Giants are growing bolder, and there's a strange unrest among the goblins. But I keep a close watch. What do you make of these developments?
[player]: I deeply respect your service to the town. Someone with your knowledge of the situation might notice things others miss.
[captain_hilda]: Thank you for your respect, soldier. Indeed, my years on the frontier have given me a keen eye for danger. I've noticed some peculiarities—like the mayor's late-night trips to the lighthouse and those strange sounds coming from the northern woods. But every piece of information is valuable in this time of uncertainty.
[player]: Trust is hard to come by these days. I hope I've shown myself worthy of it. Are there any concerning developments you've noticed among the leadership?
[captain_hilda]: The mayor's activities are indeed troubling. He frequently visits the lighthouse, and his behavior seems... off. The guards and I have grown wary of him, but we haven't found concrete proof yet. It’s best to remain vigilant until we can gather more evidence.
