[location trigger] The players approach Captain Blackwood's frozen ship in the harbor.
[npc trigger] Captain Elias Blackwood stands on the deck and calls out to the visitors below.
[player]: Captain Blackwood! Your ship is magnificent, even frozen as it is.
[captain_blackwood]: Ah, a bold greeting from one of the harbor folk. The Rusty Anchor hasn't seen such grand ships in months. What brings you to my vessel tonight?
[player]: You must have sailed to incredible places before the harbor froze over.
[captain_blackwood]: Indeed, I've seen seas as wild as a storm and skies painted with stars untold. But this eternal winter... it's a strange twist on old maps. What tale do you bring to share around my hearth?
[player]: A captain with your experience must know these waters better than anyone.
[captain_blackwood]: True enough, but the ice has made navigation tricky. There are secrets hidden beneath the frost that I'd rather not speak of just yet. Still, if you prove yourself a worthy companion, perhaps we can uncover some of those mysteries together.
[player]: I'm fascinated by tales of the sea. What discoveries have you made in your travels?
[captain_blackwood]: *Leaning forward, Captain Blackwood glances around to ensure no one else is within earshot before continuing.* Tales of discovery, eh? I've seen islands with skies that never turn dark and creatures that swim deeper than any man should venture. But the most valuable treasure I find are maps and charts, guiding me past perils others would face head-on. Would you like to see some of my findings?
[player]: I've heard rumors of uncharted islands and mysterious creatures. What have you witnessed out there?
[captain_blackwood]: *Captain Blackwood's eyes glint with a mix of excitement and caution.* I've seen things that should not exist in the light of day, like islands that appear and disappear. And once, I had an encounter with something... monstrous, lurking just below the surface. *He leans closer, lowering his voice.* If you truly want to see such wonders, prove yourself first by helping me navigate through these treacherous waters. Then perhaps, just perhaps, I'll share some of my secrets.
[player]: Please, share your knowledge of the sea. I want to hear about the places you've been and the things you've seen.
[captain_blackwood]: *Captain Blackwood gives a gruff nod, his eyes narrowing as he considers the request.* Well, a sailor's tales are not for just any ear. But since you seem eager, let me tell you of a place called the Whispering Shoals—a stretch of water so quiet even the waves whisper secrets to those who dare venture there. And then there's the Luminous Isles, where the nights glow with bioluminescent lights that dance like ethereal flames.

But beware, for these places hold dangers as well. The Sea Dragon, a creature with scales like obsidian and eyes that burn like embers, calls this territory its own. I've seen it with my own eyes, lurking beneath the waves, waiting to snatch any foolish soul who dares too close.

If you want to truly know the sea, you must prove your worth by helping me navigate these icy waters tonight. Only then might I share more of what lies hidden in the depths.
