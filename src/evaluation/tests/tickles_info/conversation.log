[location trigger] I go to the town square
[npc trigger] I approach Tickles the Mad
[player]: Your performances are brilliant! The way you satirize the nobles is both brave and hilarious.
[tickles_the_jester]: Why, thank you, kind stranger! It's not every day one finds an appreciative audience among the common folk. But remember, laughter is the best defense against tyranny—though I suppose that makes me the perfect jester for our little kingdom.
[player]: You must see everything that happens in this square. I bet you know all the town's secrets.
[tickles_the_jester]: Ah, a keen observer like yourself would surely see through my antics and suspect I've an eye on every nook and cranny! Indeed, I do have my ways of keeping tabs, though not all are for my amusement alone. What secret would you dare to ask of me tonight?
[player]: I'm curious about what really goes on behind closed doors with our leaders. Have you seen anything unusual?
[tickles_the_jester]: *leans in closer, lowering voice* Well now, if I were to divulge all the secrets I've witnessed, it might just make for a rather long evening. However, I can tell you this—there's a whisper of corruption among the higher ranks. The mayor, for one, seems more interested in his own pockets than the well-being of our town. But enough talk, let’s find you a seat and perhaps we can discuss this over some ale?
[player]: Tell me, have you noticed any strange meetings or suspicious activities from the officials?
[tickles_the_jester]: *raises an eyebrow* Strange meetings? Ah, yes, I've seen a few. The mayor has been meeting with shady characters of late—smugglers and such. But remember, in this town, every shadow can cast doubt on your neighbor. Are you prepared to uncover the truth or will you let it slide, like so many secrets do?
