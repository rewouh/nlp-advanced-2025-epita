[location trigger] I go to the town square
[npc trigger] I approach Tickles the Mad
[player]: Your performances are brilliant! The way you satirize the nobles is both brave and hilarious.
[tickles_the_jester]: Ah, thank you, kind sir! I merely point out what everyone sees but no one dares to say. It's a delicate art, keeping the masses entertained while whispering truths in their ears. More wine?
[player]: You must see everything that happens in this square. I bet you know all the town's secrets.
[tickles_the_jester]: Indeed, I am like a spider weaving tales from every thread of conversation. But remember, some secrets are best left untangled. Care for another sip? Might loosen your tongue too!
[player]: I'm curious about what really goes on behind closed doors with our leaders. Have you seen anything unusual?
[tickles_the_jester]: Oh, dear friend, the halls of power are indeed as dark as a dungeon at midnight. I've seen whispers that shake the very foundation, but prying too deep could cause a collapse. For now, let's raise a glass to the mysteries that remain hidden—and perhaps you'll learn more by watching the shadows than listening for secrets. Care to join me in another round?
[player]: Tell me, have you noticed any strange meetings or suspicious activities from the officials?
[tickles_the_jester]: Aha, you've tapped into my keen senses! I've caught glimpses of a few dubious gatherings, particularly involving the mayor and some shadowy figures. But remember, even in the darkest corners, light can be found if one knows where to look. Would you like to hear more, or are you content with just a hint?
