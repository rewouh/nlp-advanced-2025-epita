[location trigger] I go to the town square
[npc trigger] I approach Tickles the Mad
[player]: Your performances are brilliant! The way you satirize the nobles is both brave and hilarious.
[tickles_the_jester]: *Nods appreciatively, a twinkle in my eye.* Thank you, kind stranger. My wit is but a blade to cut through the dullness of this world. So, what brings such a keen mind like yours to our humble town?
[player]: You must see everything that happens in this square. I bet you know all the town's secrets.
[tickles_the_jester]: Ah, so you think your sharp eyes are as observant as mine? *leans closer* Well, let me tell you a secret or two if you prove yourself worthy of hearing them. What have you done today to earn my trust?
[player]: I'm curious about what really goes on behind closed doors with our leaders. Have you seen anything unusual?
[tickles_the_jester]: *raises an eyebrow, a mischievous glint in my eye.* Oh, I've seen enough to keep me entertained for many evenings. But secrets are like wild deer—they run faster when hunted. Tell me more about yourself, and maybe I'll share what the night whispers to the shadows.
[player]: Tell me, have you noticed any strange meetings or suspicious activities from the officials?
[tickles_the_jester]: *A smirk plays on my lips as I glance around cautiously.* Strange meetings indeed, but they're like shadows in a dark alley—hard to spot if you're not looking for them. Tell me, do you have eyes sharper than a cat's in the night? If so, let's see what you can uncover together.
