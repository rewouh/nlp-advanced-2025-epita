[location trigger] The players enter the Blood Pit Arena, watching the ongoing matches.
[npc trigger] Grimbash the Fierce approaches, sizing up the visitors with a warrior's gaze.
[player]: Grimbash! I've heard tales of your prowess in the pit. You must be an incredible warrior.
[grimbash_the_fierce]: Hmph, talk of prowess means nothing if you can't back it up with steel. Show me what you've got, and maybe I'll spit out a compliment.
[player]: The way you handle yourself in combat is legendary. I respect a fighter of your caliber.
[grimbash_the_fierce]: *Grumbles* Fine, let's see how much you know about real fighting. Get ready to spar with someone who doesn't dance around like a fool.
[player]: I can see you've earned every scar. That takes real strength and courage.
[grimbash_the_fierce]: *huffs* Strength? Courage? More like scars from foolish fights I could have avoided. But since we're talking, let's make this interesting. Prepare to watch as the fiercest blade in these parts tests your mettle.
[player]: A warrior like you must have faced all kinds of opponents. What's been your toughest fight?
[grimbash_the_fierce]: *grumbles* The toughest fight was against that mage at the Black Marsh. He cast fireball left and right, but I carved a path through his minions with my axe. *pauses, looks around warily* But let's not talk about magic users. Stick to meatheads with dull blades; they're easier to deal with.
[player]: I'm curious - in all your battles, have you ever faced anything that truly made you cautious?
[grimbash_the_fierce]: *huffs* Cautious? *laughs* I've faced my share of threats, but nothing that made me doubt my skills. The toughest was that mage, and even then, it was more about brute force than strategy. What do you think could scare a real warrior like me?
[player]: Everyone has something they're wary of, even the strongest fighters. What keeps a warrior like you on edge?
[grimbash_the_fierce]: *snorts* Wary? That's not the right word for it. It's more like... *pauses, glances around nervously* ...I don't like being near those who can weave shadows and light. Magic users are... unpredictable. They strike when least expected, with unseen power. I've seen enough of their tricks to know better than to trust them.
