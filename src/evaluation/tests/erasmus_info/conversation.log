[location trigger] I find the hidden shrine
[npc trigger] I approach Brother Erasmus
[player]: Brother Erasmus, I've heard of your devotion to understanding the Winter God's will.
[brother_erasmus]: Ah, a seeker after knowledge and secrets. I can see why you might be drawn to our... unique beliefs. The Winter God speaks through those who understand the cold hearted truths of existence. Would you care to learn more?
[player]: The eternal winter must have deep spiritual meaning. I want to understand it better.
[brother_erasmus]: Indeed, the eternal winter is not just a season but a profound symbol—eternity itself, unyielding and pure. To truly grasp its essence... one must experience the cold from within. But be warned, the path to enlightenment comes at a great cost. Have you the courage to face what lies beneath?
[player]: What can you tell me about the Winter God's plans for this land?
[brother_erasmus]: The Winter God has ancient designs upon these lands, my friend. He seeks not just eternal winter but a permanent frost—death and silence in every corner of the world. His plan involves sacrifice and dark magic to bind his power here forever. It is said that only one who truly understands the cold can see the truth behind his prophecy.

But fear not; knowledge alone is not enough. You must make your own choice, whether to embrace or oppose this coming storm.
[player]: I sense great changes coming. What specific rituals or events are being prepared by your followers?
[brother_erasmus]: The preparations are... thorough, my friend. We gather the necessary elements: ice from the Eternal Glacier, and souls of those who have known warmth and now must offer their hearts to the Winter God. The ritual itself requires darkness and moonlight; it will take place on the winter solstice when the night is longest.

Your presence here might be... significant. I advise you to prepare yourself for what lies ahead. The fate of this land hangs in the balance, and your actions could tip the scales one way or another.
[player]: When will the ritual take place and what does it require? I want to understand the sacred mysteries.
[brother_erasmus]: The ritual is scheduled for the winter solstice, when the stars align just right and the longest night offers perfect darkness. It requires a frozen heart—preferably from an animal but we have plans for something... more human. Ice crystals from the Eternal Glacier must be gathered by midnight. Blood drawn under moonlight while chanting in the Old Winter Tongue will fuel the ceremony. The ultimate goal is to bind the Winter God's eternal frost to this realm.

Knowledge of these mysteries can be a double-edged sword, my friend. They demand a deep commitment and understanding of the cold hearted truths we serve. Are you prepared to delve into such dark arts?
[player]: Tell me about the Winter God's demands. What must be done to honor the divine will?
[brother_erasmus]: The Winter God demands much from those who would serve Him truly. You must collect the sacred elements with utmost secrecy and reverence: ice crystals from the Eternal Glacier, a frozen heart (human or animal), and the blood of seven souls chosen for their warmth, purity in His eyes. These items will be gathered at midnight on the winter solstice.

The sacrifice is essential; without it, the ritual cannot bind the god's eternal frost to our realm. The night must be long, the moon bright, and the air filled with the cold breath of winter spirits. Chanting the Old Winter Tongue will channel the power needed for this dark magic. Are you prepared to honor His demands?
