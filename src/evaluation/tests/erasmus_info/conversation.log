[location trigger] I find the hidden shrine
[npc trigger] I approach Brother Erasmus
[player]: Brother Erasmus, I've heard of your devotion to understanding the Winter God's will.
[brother_erasmus]: Ah, a seeker of truth, are we? The Winter God whispers His plans through the winds and the frost. Would you like to hear His latest message? *glances around suspiciously* But be warned, not all who listen truly understand.
[player]: The eternal winter must have deep spiritual meaning. I want to understand it better.
[brother_erasmus]: Indeed, there is much to uncover in the teachings of our deity. The eternal winter signifies renewal and rebirth—cycles that are as old as time itself. *pauses, looking thoughtful* But remember, not all truths are meant for just any ear. Do you have what it takes to truly comprehend?
[player]: What can you tell me about the Winter God's plans for this land?
[brother_erasmus]: The Winter God's plans... They are subtle and insidious, like shadows creeping across a frozen landscape. He speaks in whispers through the harshest of winters, when even the bravest souls tremble. *glances around cautiously* But I can share that the eternal winter is not just a sign; it’s a call to action. The time for preparation has come.

Do you feel ready to answer this call?
[player]: I sense great changes coming. What rituals or events are being prepared by your followers?
[brother_erasmus]: The preparations are... meticulous, to say the least. Our brethren have gathered in secret, preparing the ground for a ritual that will bring about the eternal winter. *glances around nervously* It's not every day one learns of such matters, but I can tell you this: the time is near when we must call upon the Winter God in full force.

Do you sense the urgency? The world teeters on the brink of transformation. Would you like to be a part of it, or do you prefer to keep your distance?
