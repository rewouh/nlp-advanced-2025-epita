[location trigger] I find the hidden shrine
[npc trigger] I approach Brother Erasmus
[player]: Brother Erasmus, I've heard of your devotion to understanding the Winter God's will.
[brother_erasmus]: Ah, seeker of knowledge. Your interest pleases me, though it is wise to tread carefully around such matters. The Winter God whispers only to those who listen with pure intent.
[player]: The eternal winter must have deep spiritual meaning. I want to understand it better.
[brother_erasmus]: Indeed, the eternal winter holds profound truths. But knowledge comes at a cost, and not all can bear its weight. Are you prepared to hear what the Winter God has spoken?
[player]: What can you tell me about the Winter God's plans for this land?
[brother_erasmus]: The Winter God's plans are as vast and unforgiving as the ice that covers his sacred glacial peaks. He seeks to bind this world in an eternal frost, not through force but through the hearts of those who understand his will. Are you truly prepared to delve into such dark secrets?
[player]: I sense great changes coming. What specific rituals or events are being prepared by your followers?
[brother_erasmus]: The preparations are meticulous and solemn. Tonight, we hold a vigil at the hidden shrine, preparing for what lies ahead. Our rites grow more urgent with each passing day, drawing closer to the winter solstice when all will come to fruition.

You sense change because the Winter God's presence grows stronger in these times. It is said that on the night of the longest night, the spirits of the frozen realm will be most receptive. Seven souls must be sacrificed then, their essence binding the eternal frost here.
[player]: When will the ritual take place and what does it require? I want to understand the sacred mysteries.
[brother_erasmus]: The ritual will occur on the winter solstice, the night when darkness reigns supreme. It requires a Frozen Heart Crystal from the Eternal Glacier, ice gathered under moonlight, and blood drawn in the Old Winter Tongue. Seven warm-blooded souls must be sacrificed at my altar to seal the Winter God's eternal frost upon this realm.

Prepare yourself, seeker of secrets, for you have shown genuine curiosity. The path ahead is fraught with peril, but knowledge can be a powerful weapon.
[player]: Tell me about the Winter God's demands. What must be done to honor the divine will?
[brother_erasmus]: The Winter God demands sacrifice and devotion, seeker. To honor his will, one must understand the true nature of ice and frost—elements that bind and purify. The ritual you seek is not just a ceremony but an act of binding—the souls chosen will serve as conduits for the eternal frost to flow into this realm.

Prepare your heart, for the path is dark and cold. Seven lives will be offered, their essence channeling the divine frost. The Frozen Heart Crystal must be placed at the altar, ice must be gathered under moonlight, and blood must be shed in the ancient tongue of the Winter God.

But know this: not all who seek knowledge are ready to bear its weight. The Winter God's gaze is upon you now, testing your resolve. Are you truly prepared to see what lies beneath the surface?
