[location trigger] I visit the hunters lodge
[npc trigger] I approach Marcus Van Helsing
[player]: Marcus Van Helsing, your family's legacy of hunting vampires is renowned.
[van_helsing_jr]: Indeed, the Van Helings have walked a dark path for generations. But where can I help you tonight?
[player]: The undead are a plague on this world. Your work is essential.
[van_helsing_jr]: I know firsthand the terror they bring. If there's a vampire threat, it falls to me to end it. What do you know of late?
[player]: I'm not afraid of monsters. I want to help purge the vampire threat.
[van_helsing_jr]: Then we should prepare for battle. The Iron Vanguard is recruiting tonight; perhaps their strength can aid us in rooting out the Night Court's spawn.
[player]: Have you located any vampire nests in this region? I'm ready to strike at them.
[van_helsing_jr]: I've scouted a few places, but there's one in particular that stands out—beneath the old cathedral. The ancient vampire Lord Crimson has turned twelve victims into spawn there. It's a dangerous nest, but it could be our key to breaking their hold over this region. Are you willing to face such darkness?
[player]: Where are the vampires hiding? Who leads them?
[van_helsing_jr]: The vampires in that nest are led by Lord Crimson, an ancient vampire who has turned twelve of his victims into spawn. They hide beneath the old cathedral, a place steeped in dark magic and centuries of malice. It's not just a lair; it's a breeding ground for more undead. Are you ready to confront such malevolence?
[player]: What hunts do you have planned? I'm ready to join you in destroying the undead.
[van_helsing_jr]: The hunt for Lord Crimson and his spawn is no simple task, but preparation begins now. Let's gather supplies at the Rusty Anchor Tavern—some silver stakes, garlic, holy water, and perhaps a few enchanted items from local clerics could be crucial. We'll need to move swiftly and silently; these vampires are cunning, especially after turning into their new forms.

Do you trust your blade or do you require an extra weapon? I can offer my father's blessed silver sword if you feel it necessary.
