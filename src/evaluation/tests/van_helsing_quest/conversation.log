[location trigger] I visit the hunters lodge
[npc trigger] I approach Marcus Van Helsing
[player]: Marcus Van Helsing, your family's legacy of hunting vampires is renowned.
[van_helsing_jr]: Indeed, it runs deep in our blood. My father, Wilhelm, was a famed vampire hunter before me. His teachings and the tools he left behind are all I have to carry on his name.
[player]: The undead are a plague on this world. Your work is essential.
[van_helsing_jr]: Thank you for your words of support. The threat they pose never sleeps, and neither do I. If you're serious about helping, there's work to be done.
[player]: I'm not afraid of monsters. I want to help purge the vampire threat.
[van_helsing_jr]: Very well. We can start by gathering intelligence on their movements. Have you heard any recent rumors that might lead us to a nest?
[player]: Have you located any vampire nests in this region? I'm ready to strike at them.
[van_helsing_jr]: I've heard whispers of an ancient vampire lord named Lord Crimson, rumored to be nesting beneath the old cathedral. He's been turning victims into spawn, and it's only a matter of time before he strikes again. We should move quickly.
[player]: Where are the vampires hiding? Who leads them?
[van_helsing_jr]: Lord Crimson is said to lead the nest beneath the old cathedral. The place is plagued with dark magic; you'll need more than just your sword. Are you ready for that kind of challenge?
[player]: What hunts do you have planned? I'm ready to join you in destroying the undead.
[van_helsing_jr]: The first step is always reconnaissance. We need to gather intel on their activities and possibly lay a trap. I'll lead us into the catacombs beneath the old cathedral, where Lord Crimson's presence has been felt most strongly. Pack your gear; tonight we set out.
