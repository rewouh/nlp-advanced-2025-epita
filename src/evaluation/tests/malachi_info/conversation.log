[location trigger] The players enter the Shrine of Memories, surrounded by historical artifacts.
[npc trigger] Keeper Malachi greets the visitors warmly, eager to share his knowledge.
[player]: Keeper Malachi, this shrine is incredible. You've preserved so much history here.
[keeper_malachi]: Ah, greetings, traveler. Indeed, these walls hold stories from ages past. What brings you to the Memory Shrine tonight?
[player]: Your dedication to maintaining these records is admirable. The past must not be forgotten.
[keeper_malachi]: Indeed, it is a sacred duty. But remember, those who forget the past are doomed to repeat its mistakes. What story do you seek to uncover tonight?
[player]: I can see each artifact here has a story. You must know them all.
[keeper_malachi]: Every relic whispers of times long gone. Do you have a particular tale that calls to you, or perhaps a question about the origins of these items?
[player]: The Great Blizzard changed everything, but I feel like we've lost the full story over the years.
[keeper_malachi]: The Great Blizzard was indeed a pivotal event. Many tales have faded with time, yet here in the Memory Shrine, some whisperings remain. Would you like to hear of the storm that shook the very foundations of our world?
[player]: Someone with your knowledge must understand what truly happened. Would you share what you know about the beginning of the eternal winter?
[keeper_malachi]: The Great Blizzard, as it is known now, began with a simple warning from the north. A comet, believed by some to be a harbinger of doom, passed close to our world. Its passage was marked by strange lights and an eerie silence that chilled even the bravest hearts. From that night onward, the weather turned unpredictable, and frost lingered where warmth should have been.

As the days wore on, snow fell in unprecedented amounts, covering fields and forests alike. The first snowflakes of what would become the eternal winter began to fall on the fourth day after the comet's passage. It started as a light dusting but soon turned into a relentless storm that lasted for weeks without ceasing.

The people of our realm were unprepared for such an event, and many perished in the early days. Those who survived banded together, seeking shelter from the cold and hunger. The Great Blizzard tested the very resilience of our world, shaping it as much as it was shaped by those who endured.

Would you like to hear more about those first days, or perhaps a specific aspect of the storm that interests you?
[player]: Are there any historical secrets that have been forgotten by most? I'm eager to learn the complete truth.
[keeper_malachi]: The Great Blizzard holds many secrets, traveler. Among them is the tale of the First King's last stand. He foresaw the coming winter and prepared for it as best he could, but his wisdom was not enough to save him from the storm's wrath. His crown, a symbol of power and duty, was lost in the chaos.

Do you seek knowledge about this, or are there other facets of history that intrigue you?
