[location trigger] The players enter the Shrine of Memories, surrounded by historical artifacts.
[npc trigger] Keeper Malachi greets the visitors warmly, eager to share his knowledge.
[player]: Keeper Malachi, this shrine is incredible. You've preserved so much history here.
[keeper_malachi]: Ah, greetings traveler. The memory of the past is indeed precious, and I am but a humble guardian of those memories. What brings you to the Memory Shrine tonight?
[player]: Your dedication to maintaining these records is admirable. The past must not be forgotten.
[keeper_malachi]: Indeed, it is my duty to ensure that history does not fade into obscurity. Do you seek any particular piece of knowledge or perhaps a story from long ago?
[player]: I can see each artifact here has a story. You must know them all.
[keeper_malachi]: Each relic whispers tales of days gone by, and I have listened to their murmurs for many years. What story do you find most compelling?
[player]: The Great Blizzard changed everything, but I feel like we've lost the full story over the years.
[keeper_malachi]: Ah, the Great Blizzard is a tale shrouded in both trepidation and awe. Many have tried to forget its wrath, yet it remains etched in every stone of this land. Would you like to hear how it began, or perhaps the trials faced by those who survived? The full story is indeed vast and complex.
[player]: Someone with your knowledge must understand what truly happened. Would you share what you know about the beginning of the eternal winter?
[keeper_malachi]: The Great Blizzard... It began with an unseasonable chill, a whisper of frost that crept into the heart of our land. Many believed it was but a fleeting cold snap, a minor inconvenience. But as days turned to weeks and weeks to months, the snow kept falling, heavier and more relentless than any winter before.

The first true sign of its severity came when the river froze solid, isolating villages from one another. Families huddled together, sharing what little warmth they could muster, unaware that this was merely the start. Can you imagine the terror when the sun itself seemed to wither in the sky, replaced by an endless twilight?

The story is long and filled with countless acts of heroism and hardship. Would you like me to recount one of those stories, or do you seek a more detailed account?
[player]: Are there any historical secrets that have been forgotten by most? I'm eager to learn the complete truth.
[keeper_malachi]: The Great Blizzard is indeed a tale filled with forgotten truths and hidden heroes. There are whispers of a prophecy that foretold its coming, yet many believe it was merely a myth. Do you wish to hear about those who foresaw the storm's approach? Or perhaps tales of those who resisted the encroaching ice, fighting against the very elements themselves?
