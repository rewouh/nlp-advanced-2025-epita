[location trigger] I visit the shipyard
[npc trigger] I approach Master Roderick Oakenheart
[player]: Master Oakenheart, your dedication to shipbuilding despite the frozen harbor is inspiring.
[master_oakenheart]: Ah, thank you, but these times are tough for a shipwright. The ice is thicker than ever, and yet I cannot let go of the traditions passed down through generations. Have you heard of the Iron Vanguard's call for mercenaries? It might be an opportunity for some well-armed sailors.
[player]: The craftsmanship of your vessels is legendary. You're keeping the shipwright tradition alive.
[master_oakenheart]: Indeed, every plank and rivet tells a tale of skill and perseverance. But let me ask you, have you heard of any unusual occurrences lately? The lighthouse has been making strange noises at night, and some say the northern farms are being raided by goblins. Such disturbances could test even the finest ship.
[player]: I believe the ice will break eventually, and your ships will sail again.
[master_oakenheart]: True words, but the wait is long and harsh. Until then, I must keep my hands busy with whatever work comes my way. Perhaps you can find a use for some of our surplus wood or tools?
[player]: Have you designed any ships specifically to break through the ice? That would be revolutionary.
[master_oakenheart]: Indeed, it would be a groundbreaking achievement. I have considered such designs, and they require materials not found in these frozen lands—reinforced titanium hulls and enchanted steam engines, to withstand the pressures of the ice. The blueprints for such a vessel are kept securely hidden. Perhaps when the time is right, we can work together on something truly remarkable.
[player]: Do you have plans or blueprints for such a vessel? I'd love to learn about it.
[master_oakenheart]: I do have some notes and sketches, but the complete blueprints are guarded closely. They were entrusted to me by Master Thorin Ironkeel himself, and they include schematics for magical heating cores and ice-shattering rams. However, they are hidden away in a waterproof case beneath the third floorboard of my office. I trust you with such knowledge, but let us first see if there is a need for such a vessel.
[player]: What materials do you need to complete your greatest work? I can help acquire them.
[master_oakenheart]: To complete the Icebreaker Leviathan, one must gather rare and exotic materials that are not readily available here in these frozen climes. Reinforced titanium is among the hardest metals known, while enchanted steam engines require a mixture of arcane components and precious stones. I fear such resources are beyond your reach at present, but with determination and a bit of luck, we might yet find what we need. Do you have any leads on where to begin this quest?
