[location trigger] I visit the shipyard
[npc trigger] I approach Master Roderick Oakenheart
[player]: Master Oakenheart, your dedication to shipbuilding despite the frozen harbor is inspiring.
[master_oakenheart]: Ah, greetings, friend. The cold winds may howl, but they cannot quench the heart of a true shipwright. What brings you to my humble shipyard on such a frosty evening?
[player]: The craftsmanship of your vessels is legendary. You're keeping the shipwright tradition alive.
[master_oakenheart]: Indeed, every plank and spar holds the spirit of our ancestors. And though these docks are frozen over, the craft of shipbuilding never truly freezes. What tales bring you to seek out a shipwright's wisdom?
[player]: I believe the ice will break eventually, and your ships will sail again.
[master_oakenheart]: Aye, there is always hope in the heart of winter. Yet, even as we wait for the ice to thaw, we must prepare for when it does. Have you any specific needs or inquiries regarding our craft?
[player]: Have you designed any ships specifically to break through the ice? That would be revolutionary.
[master_oakenheart]: Ah, a bold suggestion indeed. The concept of an icebreaker vessel is intriguing, though few have dared to venture into such uncharted waters. I do possess plans for just such a ship—albeit hidden away in my office, for now. They are the work of Master Thorin Ironkeel himself, crafted with reinforced titanium hulls and enchanted steam engines capable of withstanding the harshest of ice conditions.

Would you like to see them? Trustworthy eyes would be necessary to unlock their secrets.
[player]: Do you have plans or blueprints for such a vessel? I'd love to learn about it.
[master_oakenheart]: I do indeed have the plans, hidden beneath the third floorboard in my office. They detail a vessel named the Icebreaker Leviathan, designed with reinforced titanium hulls and enchanted steam engines. However, these are sacred documents, meant for those who truly understand their purpose. Would you swear to me that you will use this knowledge responsibly?
[player]: What materials do you need to complete your greatest work? I can help acquire them.
[master_oakenheart]: Ah, a true ally in the cold north! To build the Icebreaker Leviathan, one must gather rare and powerful components. You would need reinforced titanium from the deep mines of Gorthor, enchanted steam engines crafted by the Arcane Forge of Eldoria, and magical heating cores that can withstand the coldest of ice. These are not easily found, but with your aid, I might just see this vision to fruition.

Shall we make a deal? You gather the materials, and I will prepare the blueprints.
