[location trigger] The players descend into the Frozen Depths Mines.
[npc trigger] Borin Deepdelver stops his work and greets the visitors, wiping sweat from his brow.
[player]: Borin, the work you do down here is dangerous and important. You're a brave man.
[borin_deepdelver]: Thank you for the kind words. Ain't much to be brave about, just trying to keep my family fed and warm. How's business in the tavern tonight? Anything interesting going on out there?
[player]: I can see you're a hard worker. The town depends on miners like you.
[borin_deepdelver]: Ain't nobody counting on me more than I count on myself, but we all got our parts to play, right? Heard tell of some strange noises comin' from the sea lately. Might be somethin' worth lookin' into.
[player]: I'm experienced in dealing with dangerous situations and creatures.
[borin_deepdelver]: That's good to hear. The mines can get a bit... lively at times. Maybe you could help me keep an eye out for whatever's been stirring in the depths. I've heard some rumors too, but haven't had the nerve to check it out myself.
[player]: Have you found anything unusual deep in the mines? Ancient structures or passages?
[borin_deepdelver]: *Glances around cautiously, tapping his boot against the stone floor.* There be some old ruins down on level 7. A temple to a fire god, I reckon. Some runic stuff glows faintly in there now and then. But it's deep, dark, and not easy to navigate. Not many brave enough to venture that far without payin' for it first.
[player]: I've heard rumors of ruins beneath this region. Have you discovered anything like that?
[borin_deepdelver]: *Nods his head.* Yeah, I found somethin' down on level 7. An old temple, maybe a hundred years older than the blizzard that froze these mines. It's got some glowing runes and artifacts inside. But it ain't exactly safe to go there alone. More trouble than treasure, usually.
[player]: If there's anything threatening the mining operation, I'd be happy to help handle it.
[borin_deepdelver]: *Leans forward, eyes narrowing slightly.* That sounds like a fair offer. The mines have been getting a bit restless lately. If you're up for it, we could use someone with your experience. Lead the way when we go down there tonight, and maybe together we can figure out what's stirring in those dark depths.
[player]: What challenges are you facing down here? I'm ready to take on difficult tasks.
[borin_deepdelver]: *Looks at you with a mix of admiration and caution.* The main challenge is the sheer darkness and cold. It's easy to lose your way, and the deeper you go, the colder it gets. Besides that, there are always those... *pauses, glancing around as if listening for something.* whispers in the shadows, and the ground can be treacherous with hidden cracks and ice. But if we're prepared, I reckon we can handle whatever comes our way. Ready to make a deal?
