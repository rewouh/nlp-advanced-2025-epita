[location trigger] The players enter the Mountain Smithy, volcanic heat radiating from the forge.
[npc trigger] Greta Stonefist sets down her hammer and nods at the visitors with respect.
[player]: Greta Stonefist! Your craftsmanship is renowned even among the dwarven clans.
[greta_stonefist]: Ah, greetings there. I do my best with what I've got. What brings you to my forge at such a late hour? Need something sturdy or sharp?
[player]: I can see the quality in every piece you forge. True artistry combined with function.
[greta_stonefist]: Thank you for your kind words. Many seek my skills, but few find what they truly need here. What might I make for you tonight?
[player]: Your no-nonsense approach to smithing is refreshing. You let the work speak for itself.
[greta_stonefist]: *Nods in acknowledgment.* Well, if it's not about just the work, then tell me why you seek my forge at this hour. What do you have in mind?
[player]: I'm preparing to face frost giants in the northern mountains. It's dangerous work, but necessary.
[greta_stonefist]: Then I understand your need for something special. I can craft a weapon that'll cut through even the coldest of foes. But remember, it won't be easy and it won't come cheap. Can you handle the strain?
[player]: A weapon forged by your hands would be an honor to carry into battle. Do you have anything suited for fighting giants?
[greta_stonefist]: Indeed, a weapon from my forge carries with it a bit of dwarven pride. I've been working on just such a piece—specifically designed for the might of frost giants. It's heavy and sturdy, meant to pierce through their armor like it was made of paper.

But let me ask you: are you prepared? This isn't just any weapon; it requires a strength and skill that few can match. Can you handle such a burden?
[player]: I promise to wield it with honor and put it to good use defending those who cannot defend themselves.
[greta_stonefist]: Very well, then. Your resolve is clear. Follow me to the forge, and let us see what can be done. The darkness of night will soon give way to the light of your battle against the frost giants.
