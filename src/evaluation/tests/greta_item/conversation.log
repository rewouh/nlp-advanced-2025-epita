[location trigger] The players enter the Mountain Smithy, volcanic heat radiating from the forge.
[npc trigger] Greta Stonefist sets down her hammer and nods at the visitors with respect.
[player]: Greta Stonefist! Your craftsmanship is renowned even among the dwarven clans.
[greta_stonefist]: Ah, greetings to you. I strive to live up to such praise, but the true test lies in the hands that wield my creations. What brings you to the mountain smithy this evening?
[player]: I can see the quality in every piece you forge. True artistry combined with function.
[greta_stonefist]: Thank you for your kind words. The materials and craftsmanship are all I have to offer, but they must serve a purpose. What do you seek from me tonight?
[player]: Your no-nonsense approach to smithing is refreshing. You let the work speak for itself.
[greta_stonefist]: A true craftsman lets his creations stand on their own merits. Now, what can I help you with today? Need something forged or simply here for a chat about our trade?
[player]: I'm preparing to face frost giants in the northern mountains. It's dangerous work, but necessary.
[greta_stonefist]: I understand your resolve. The north can be harsh. Have you considered the weapon I crafted specifically against frost giants? It could see you through those cold climes. Would you like to see it?
[player]: A weapon forged by your hands would be an honor to carry into battle. Do you have anything suited for fighting giants?
[greta_stonefist]: I do, indeed. The Giant Slayer axe is designed for just such a task. It's heavy and fearsome, but the weight will anchor you as you cleave through frost giant flesh. Would you like to see it now?
[player]: I promise to wield it with honor and put it to good use defending those who cannot defend themselves.
[greta_stonefist]: Very well, then. Follow me to my workbench, and I shall show you the Giant Slayer axe. It's a hefty piece, but it'll serve you well in your quest.
