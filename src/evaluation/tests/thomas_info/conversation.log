[location trigger] I go to the survivor camp
[npc trigger] I approach Thomas the Survivor
[player]: Thomas, your survival is remarkable. You're an inspiration to everyone.
[thomas_survivor]: Thank you for the kind words, but I just try to help where I can. We all need to pull together if we're going to make it through this.
[player]: I'm grateful you're helping others survive and sharing your knowledge.
[thomas_survivor]: I just want to do what I can. Sharing what little I know might save lives, after all. But be careful—knowledge comes with its own dangers.
[player]: The frost plague has been devastating. I want to understand what really happened.
[thomas_survivor]: I understand your curiosity, but the truth is dangerous. What you saw and heard... it's better left buried. Focus on surviving, and maybe one day, we can uncover the truth together.
[player]: You were there when it started. What did you see? Was the plague natural?
[thomas_survivor]: I saw something far worse than a natural outbreak. Three figures in silver masks appeared in the village at night, spreading a contaminated powder into the well and grain stores. One dropped a medallion with an eerie symbol before vanishing. I tracked them to an abandoned monastery where I found evidence of plague cultivation. It wasn't just nature's doing; someone wanted us to suffer.
[player]: Did you see anyone suspicious before the outbreak? Anyone who might have caused it?
[thomas_survivor]: I didn’t see any strangers before, but the signs were there if I knew what to look for. The black carriage with no horses appeared two days before everything went downhill. It’s a strange coincidence that such an unusual vehicle showed up just as things started going wrong. But remember, seeing is one thing; proving it was intentional is another challenge entirely.
[player]: Please tell me everything you remember. These details could help prevent another outbreak.
[thomas_survivor]: I understand the urgency, but revealing too much could put us all in danger. What if those responsible find out? They might come after us again.

However, I can share what I know without naming names or places. The key is to be cautious and look for patterns. The black carriage with no horses was a red flag. Keep your guard up and watch for anyone acting suspiciously. Also, be wary of any unusual deliveries or strange people asking questions about the village.

If you need more details, consider speaking to others who were around when things started. They might remember something you missed.
