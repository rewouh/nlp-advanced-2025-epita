[location trigger] I go to the survivor camp
[npc trigger] I approach Thomas the Survivor
[player]: Thomas, your survival is remarkable. You're an inspiration to everyone.
[thomas_survivor]: Thank you for the kind words. I just try to help where I can. We all have our roles in this world.
[player]: I'm grateful you're helping others survive and sharing your knowledge.
[thomas_survivor]: It's important to pass on what we learn, even if it's just a little bit at a time. Together, we stand a better chance.
[player]: The frost plague has been devastating. I want to understand what really happened.
[thomas_survivor]: I can see why you're curious. The truth is dark and twisted. It involves those strange figures with the silver masks and the black carriage... *pauses* I don't know if you're ready for that, but it's important to know the whole story.
[player]: You were there when it started. What did you see? Was the plague natural?
[thomas_survivor]: The plague wasn't natural by any means. I saw three figures in silver masks spreading contaminated powder in the village well and grain stores at midnight. One of them dropped a medallion bearing the symbol of the Circle of Winter's Embrace cult. It was... unsettling to witness such deliberate acts of destruction.
[player]: Did you see anyone suspicious before the outbreak? Anyone who might have caused it?
[thomas_survivor]: Before the outbreak, I noticed strange figures arriving in a black carriage with no visible horses. They spoke in an ancient tongue and seemed to know exactly what they were doing. Their presence was... unsettling. It wasn't until later that I pieced together their connection to the plague.
[player]: Please tell me everything you remember. These details could help prevent another outbreak.
[thomas_survivor]: I understand why you need every detail, but it's a heavy burden to bear—especially knowing what those figures did. Let me recount as best I can: There were three of them, dressed in silver masks that hid their faces. They arrived on the eve of the plague, speaking in an ancient language, and vanished after they spread the powder. One dropped a medallion with the symbol of the Circle of Winter's Embrace cult.

Their carriage was black and mysterious, without any horses visible. The figures seemed to know exactly what they were doing, as if they had planned this for months. I tracked them to an abandoned monastery in the Frostpeak Mountains where I found evidence of plague cultivation chambers. The facility was well-equipped with ancient tools and containers filled with strange powders.

Can you take my medallion? It might provide some insight into their cult. *hands over a small, metallic disc*
