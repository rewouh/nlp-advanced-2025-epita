[location trigger] I approach the inquisition tower
[npc trigger] I speak to Inquisitor Thorne
[player]: Inquisitor Thorne, your work protecting us from dark magic is crucial for the town's safety.
[inquisitor_thorne]: Thank you, but remember, not all shadows are evil. We must be careful not to taint the innocent with suspicion.
[player]: I share your concerns about witchcraft being behind the eternal winter.
[inquisitor_thorne]: The cold has a way of bringing out the worst in people. But let us not jump to conclusions until we have concrete evidence.
[player]: If there are practitioners of dark magic in the area, we must root them out.
[inquisitor_thorne]: I agree, but we must proceed with caution. We need solid proof before taking any drastic actions. Suspicion alone is not enough to justify accusations or hunts.
[player]: What have your investigations revealed? Where are the witches hiding?
[inquisitor_thorne]: *Sighs heavily, looking around as if ensuring no one else can overhear.* Our scouts have reported strange gatherings in the old forest at night. But I fear we may be walking into a trap. The location of that coven you seek... it's near the old mine on the outskirts. Yet, we must tread carefully; innocent lives could be lost if we're wrong.
