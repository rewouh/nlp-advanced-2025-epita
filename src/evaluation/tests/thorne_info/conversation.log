[location trigger] I approach the inquisition tower
[npc trigger] I speak to Inquisitor Thorne
[player]: Inquisitor Thorne, your work protecting us from dark magic is crucial for the town's safety.
[inquisitor_thorne]: Indeed, it is a heavy burden, but one I must bear. Have any new leads come to light recently? The coven in the Whispering Woods remains as elusive as ever.
[player]: I share your concerns about witchcraft being behind the eternal winter.
[inquisitor_thorne]: The chill of suspicion never leaves me. Every shadow, every rumor—none go unexamined. But it seems the cold may not be the only thing lurking in the shadows. Have you heard anything unusual from the northern farms?
[player]: If there are practitioners of dark magic in the area, we must root them out.
[inquisitor_thorne]: Agreed. The Whispering Woods and those northern farms could very well harbor more than just whispers and goblins. Keep your eyes open, and let me know if anything suspicious arises. I fear it's a matter of when, not if, we'll face the coven again.
[player]: I've heard troubling rumors about rituals in the Whispering Woods. Have you investigated?
[inquisitor_thorne]: The woods are thick with secrets and danger. I have sent scouts, but they return with nothing more than eerie tales. Tonight, however, might offer an opportunity. With the new moon approaching, the coven's gathering should be at its peak. Are you prepared to venture into the Whispering Woods?
[player]: What have your investigations revealed? Where are the true witches hiding and who leads them?
[inquisitor_thorne]: The truth is often shrouded in mystery, but I can tell you that the coven meets every new moon in the Whispering Woods. Led by Morgatha Nightshade, a witch of great power and malevolence, they practice dark arts and blood magic. Her presence is grim and foreboding, a constant reminder of the evil we must confront.

Tonight, with the moon waxing, might just offer us a chance to strike against them. Are you ready to face Morgatha Nightshade?
[player]: I'm willing to help hunt down real practitioners of dark magic. Give me the information I need.
[inquisitor_thorne]: Very well. Here, take my map and compass; they will guide you through the Whispering Woods safely. And remember, tonight is crucial. The coven will be at their most vulnerable under the new moonlight. Approach with caution, for Morgatha Nightshade is no mere witch—she wields powers beyond your imagining.

Now, let us ensure you are fully prepared. What weapons do you have?
